eng	Today is June 18th and it is Muiriel's birthday!
eng	Muiriel is 20 now.
eng	The password is "Muiriel".
eng	I will be back soon.
eng	I'm at a loss for words.
eng	This is never going to end.
eng	I just don't know what to say.
eng	That was an evil bunny.
eng	I was in the mountains.
eng	Is it a recent picture?
eng	I don't know if I have the time.
eng	Education in this world disappoints me.
eng	You're in better shape than I am.
eng	You are in my way.
eng	This will cost €30.
eng	I make €100 a day.
eng	I may give up soon and just nap instead.
eng	It's because you don't want to be alone.
eng	That won't happen.
eng	Sometimes he can be a strange guy.
eng	I'll do my best not to disturb your studying.
eng	I can only wonder if this is the same for everyone else.
eng	I suppose it's different when you think about it over the long term.
eng	I miss you.
eng	I'll call them tomorrow when I come back.
eng	I always liked mysterious characters more.
eng	You should sleep.
eng	I'm going to go.
eng	I told them to send me another ticket.
eng	You're so impatient with me.
eng	I can't live that kind of life.
eng	I once wanted to be an astrophysicist.

eng	They are too busy fighting against each other to care for common ideals.

eng	That's MY line!
eng	He's kicking me!
eng	Are you sure?
eng	Then there is a problem...
eng	Oh, there's a butterfly!
eng	Hurry up.
eng	It doesn't surprise me.
eng	For some reason I feel more alive at night.
eng	It depends on the context.
eng	Are you freaking kidding me?!
eng	That's the stupidest thing I've ever said.
eng	I don't want to be lame; I want to be cool!!
eng	When I grow up, I want to be a king.
eng	America is a lovely place to be, if you are here to earn money.
eng	I'm so fat.
eng	So what?
eng	I'm gonna shoot him.
eng	I'm not a real fish, I'm just a mere plushy.
eng	I'm just saying!
eng	That was probably what influenced their decision.
eng	I've always wondered what it'd be like to have siblings.
eng	This is what I would have said.
eng	It would take forever for me to explain everything.
eng	That's because you're a girl.
eng	Sometimes I can't help showing emotions.
eng	It's a word I'd like to find a substitute for.
eng	It would be something I'd have to program.
eng	I don't intend to be selfish.
eng	Let's consider the worst that could happen.
eng	How many close friends do you have?
eng	I may be antisocial, but it doesn't mean I don't talk to people.
eng	This is always the way it has been.
eng	I think it is best not to be impolite.
eng	One can always find time.
eng	I'd be unhappy, but I wouldn't kill myself.
eng	Back in high school, I got up at 6 a.m. every morning.
eng	When I woke up, I was sad.
eng	That is somewhat explained at the end.

eng	Every person who is alone is alone because they are afraid of others.
eng	Why do you ask?
eng	I am not an artist. I never had the knack for it.

eng	I am a flawed person, but these are flaws that can easily be fixed.
eng	Whenever I find something I like, it's too expensive.
eng	How long did you stay?
eng	Maybe it will be exactly the same for him.
eng	Innocence is a beautiful thing.
eng	Humans were never meant to live forever.
eng	I don't want to lose my ideas, even though some of them are a bit extreme.
eng	I think I have a theory about that.
eng	That is intriguing.
eng	You are saying you intentionally hide your good looks?
eng	I do not have an account in these forums.
eng	If anyone was to ask what the point of the story is, I really don't know.
eng	I didn't know where it came from.
eng	I think my living with you has influenced your way of living.
eng	This is not important.
eng	I didn't like it.
eng	She's asking how that's possible.
eng	You're just running away from life's problems.
eng	If you look at the lyrics, they don't really mean much.
eng	There's a problem there that you don't see.

eng	My physics teacher doesn't care if I skip classes.
eng	I wish I could go to Japan.
eng	I hate it when there are a lot of people.
eng	I have to go to bed.
eng	After that, I left, but then I realized that I forgot my backpack at their house.
eng	I won't ask you anything else today.
eng	It may freeze next week.
eng	Even though he apologized, I'm still furious.
eng	The police will get you to find the bullets.
eng	Thanks for having explained to me at last why people take me for an idiot.
eng	That wasn't my intention.
eng	Thanks for your explanation.
eng	Theoretically, I'm doing math.
eng	If you didn't know me that way then you simply didn't know me.
eng	It almost scared me not to see you online for a whole day.
eng	I don't know what you mean.
eng	My computer has got to be useful for something.
eng	You wanted to tell me about freedom?
eng	Uh, now it's really weird...
eng	If I wanted to scare you, I would tell you what I dreamt about a few weeks ago.
eng	One can't expect everything from schools.
eng	There are many words that I don't understand.
eng	I don't like it when mathematicians who know much more than I do can't express themselves explicitly.
eng	You're really not stupid.
eng	I need to ask you a silly question.
eng	I don't know how to demonstrate it, since it's too obvious!
eng	I wouldn't have thought I would someday look up "Viagra" in Wikipedia.
eng	Can it be phrased in another way?
eng	No one will know.
eng	I found a solution, but I found it so fast that it can't be the right solution.
eng	It seems interesting to me.
eng	Except that here, it's not so simple.
eng	I like candlelight.
eng	What did you answer?
eng	No, he's not my new boyfriend.
eng	It's too bad that I don't need to lose weight.
eng	You never have class or what?!
eng	I will play Sudoku then instead of continuing to bother you.
eng	Where is the problem?
eng	I can only wait.
eng	It's not much of a surprise, is it?
eng	I love you.
eng	I don't like you anymore.
eng	I am curious.
eng	Congratulations!
eng	I don't want to wait that long.
eng	Why don't you come visit us?
eng	But the possibility seems unlikely.
fra	Pour une fois dans ma vie je fais un bon geste... Et ça ne sert à rien.
eng	I shouldn't have logged off.
eng	I don't know what to do anymore.
eng	It is inevitable that I go to France someday, I just don't know when.
eng	I hate chemistry.
eng	I didn't want this to happen.
eng	You can probably guess what happens though.
eng	Next thing you know, you'll be in the papers.
eng	What other options do I have?
eng	I am not much of a traveller.
eng	I have nothing better to do.
eng	I can't explain it either.
eng	Everyone has strengths and weaknesses.
eng	Seriously though, episode 21 made me almost cry while laughing.
eng	It only shows you're not a robot.
eng	How could I be a robot? Robots don't dream.
eng	It's not something anyone can do.
eng	I don't know if I still have it.
eng	What do you think I've been doing?
eng	Don't underestimate my power.
eng	My mom doesn't speak English very well.
eng	I don't speak French well enough!
eng	I was wondering if you were going to show up today.
eng	Therein lies the problem.
eng	How do you find food in outer space?
eng	All you can do is trust one another.
eng	Everyone wants to meet you. You're famous!
eng	Why are you sorry for something you haven't done?
eng	I utterly despise formal writing!
eng	Foreign people intrigue me.
eng	Whatever I do, she says I can do better.
eng	What keeps you up so late?
eng	You'd be surprised what you can learn in a week.
eng	I don't have anyone who'd travel with me.
eng	You're not fast enough.
eng	Life is hard, but I am harder.
eng	Bearing can be unbearable.
eng	Stop it! You're making her feel uncomfortable!
eng	Nothing is beautiful but the truth.
eng	Tomorrow, he will land on the moon.
eng	I don't speak Japanese.
eng	This is a pun.
eng	Nobody understands me.
eng	I learned to live without her.
eng	It's useless to keep on thinking any more.
eng	I have too many things on my mind these days.
eng	I just wanted to check my email.
eng	Do you really need to ask the question to know the answer?
eng	You can't expect me to always think of everything!
eng	I suppose that behind each thing we have to do, there's something we want to do...
eng	You really don't have the right priorities!
eng	Don't expect others to think for you!
eng	You never have time for important things!
eng	It's no use pretending to make me believe that I believe things you don't believe!
eng	It would take me too much time to explain to you why it's not going to work.
eng	I'm so dumb... I'm trying to explain things to you that I don't understand myself.
eng	Stop seeing me as a "normal" person!
eng	Are you referring to me?
eng	There will always be things I will never learn, I don't have eternity before me!
eng	It can't be!
eng	I wish I could care more about my grades but it seems that, at a certain point of my life, I decided they wouldn't be so important anymore.

eng	Nothing is impossible for the man who doesn't have to do it himself.
eng	That's the thing about people who think they hate computers. What they really hate is lousy programmers.
eng	It is not the strongest of the species that survive, not the most intelligent, but the one most responsive to change.
eng	I think it is good that books still exist, but they do make me sleepy.
eng	I can't understand why people are frightened of new ideas. I'm frightened of the old ones.

eng	I didn't know he drank so much.
eng	Any activity you need to accomplish will take more time than you have.
eng	It's well done.
eng	Do you want fruit juice?
eng	He's a good person.
eng	Do as you want.
eng	Enjoy your meal!
eng	There's no love without jealousy.

eng	Why aren't you coming with us?
eng	I can't say the opposite.
eng	Why are you telling me about hippos all of the sudden? I don't see the connection between that and your twelve red goldfishes.
eng	Don't listen to him, he's talking nonsense.
eng	You can't get lost in big cities; there are maps everywhere!
eng	We are sorry, the person you are trying to contact is not available.
eng	I don't want it anymore.
eng	He came several times.
eng	We wonder why.
eng	We must think about friends.
eng	I'm going to take a bath.
eng	It was raining when we left, but by the time we arrived, it was sunny.
eng	We left by train.
eng	If you eat too much, you'll become fat.
eng	I don't know if he would have done it for me.
eng	Would you like to come?
eng	I knew he would accept.
eng	She would willingly come but she was on vacation.
eng	I thought it was true.
eng	This is the town I told you about.
eng	This is the boy I think about.
eng	He has been warned on several occasions.
eng	I have to give back the book before Saturday.
eng	We tried so hard to make things better for our kids that we made them worse.
eng	Hi, I just wanted to let you know that the problem is fixed.
eng	How can you have a laptop and not a cell phone?
eng	I went to drink a beer with friends.
eng	He jumped out the window.
eng	Yesterday we had fun.
eng	They quarreled.
eng	I ate caviar.
eng	He changed a lot since the last time.
eng	This knife was very useful to me.
eng	You took the wrong key.
eng	I managed to get in.
eng	How much is it?
eng	I'll bring you the bill immediately.
eng	Here is your change.
eng	I'll pay by cheque.
eng	Did you leave a tip?
eng	Don't forget the ticket.
eng	I'm sorry, I don't have change.
eng	The situation is worse than we believed.
eng	We have to expect the worst.
eng	They don't even know why.
eng	I want you to tell me the truth.
eng	You arrived at the moment I left.
eng	Muiriel likes to annoy me lately.
eng	It's not serious, I don't bear him a grudge.
eng	Who is coming with me?
eng	I want to know who is coming with us.
eng	Florence is the most beautiful city in Italy.
eng	On your feet, children!
eng	I talked to friends.
eng	The film started at 2 o'clock.
eng	This girl changed her look.
eng	The film lasted 2 hours.
eng	I'm glad to see you back.
eng	You changed a lot.
eng	Those who know him like him.
eng	Tell me what happened.
eng	They are sensible girls.
eng	How beautiful you are!
eng	It's easier to have fun than to work.
eng	You must work more.
eng	It's more difficult than you think.
eng	He told me he would go to Venice.
eng	Who are those guys?
eng	I don't agree with him.
eng	The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak.
eng	There's quite a lot of things to do; do you want some help?
eng	It seems to me that the train is late.
eng	He learned the news while reading the newspaper.
eng	I don't know if I'll have time to do it.
eng	Ask Trang if he's going out this evening.
eng	She's got a fair complexion while her brother is very dark.
eng	In a town you may pass unnoticed, whereas in a village it's impossible.
eng	Who said that? It's totally wrong!
eng	When I was a child, I would spend hours reading alone in my room.
eng	Wolves won't usually attack people.
eng	"Can somebody help me?" "I will."
eng	Please will you close the door when you go out.
eng	You've given me your cold.
eng	Ah! If I were rich, I'd buy myself a house in Spain.
eng	I wish she would stop playing that stupid music.
eng	I hope he'll be able to come! I'd like to see him.
eng	They will never accept; it's too far.
eng	Her garden is a work of art.
eng	I'd rather be a bird than a fish.

eng	If you take care of the small things, the big things will take care of themselves.
eng	Every man's work, whether it be literature or music or a picture or architecture or anything else, is always a portrait of himself.
eng	When we seek to discover the best in others, we somehow bring out the best in ourselves.
eng	Forget it. It's not worth it.
eng	We're going to eat a lot tonight so I hope you're not on a diet.
spa	¡Intentemos algo!
spa	Tengo que irme a dormir.
spa	¿Qué estás haciendo?
spa	¿Qué es eso?
spa	¡Hoy es 18 de junio y es el cumpleaños de Muiriel!
spa	¡Feliz cumpleaños, Muiriel!
spa	Ahora, Muiriel tiene 20 años.
spa	La contraseña es "Muiriel".
spa	Volveré pronto.
spa	No tengo palabras.
spa	Esto no acabará nunca.
spa	Simplemente no sé qué decir...
spa	Era un conejo malo.
spa	Yo estaba en las montañas.
spa	¿Es una foto reciente?
spa	No sé si tengo tiempo.
spa	Por alguna razón, el micrófono no había funcionado hasta entonces.
spa	Todo el mundo debe aprender por sí mismo al final.
spa	La educación en este mundo me decepciona.
spa	El aprendizaje no debe ser forzado, sino estimulado.
spa	Es una tarea difícil elegir qué está "bien" o "mal", pero has de hacerlo.
spa	Eso no va a cambiar nada.
spa	Eso va a costar 30 €.
spa	Gano 100 € al día.
spa	Quizás me dé pronto por vencido y en lugar de eso me eche una siesta.
spa	Eso es porque no quieres estar solo.
spa	Eso no va a pasar.
spa	A veces él puede ser un chico raro.
spa	Me voy a esforzar por no molestarte en tus estudios.
spa	Sólo puedo preguntarme si acaso es lo mismo para todos los demás.
spa	Supongo que es diferente cuando lo consideras a largo plazo.
spa	No te preocupes.
spa	Los llamaré cuando regrese mañana.
spa	Siempre me gustaron más los personajes misteriosos.
spa	Deberías dormir.
spa	Les dije que me mandaran otro boleto.
spa	Eres tan impaciente conmigo.
spa	No puedo vivir así.
spa	Una vez quise ser astrofísico.
spa	Nunca me gustó la biología.
spa	La última persona a la que le conté mi idea pensó que yo estaba loco.
spa	Si el mundo no fuera como es, yo podría confiar en cualquiera.
spa	Desafortunadamente es verdad.
spa	Están muy ocupados peleándose entre ellos, como para preocuparse por los ideales comunes.
spa	La mayoría de la gente cree que estoy loco.
spa	¡No, no lo soy! ¡Lo eres tú!
spa	¡Esa es mi frase!
spa	¡¡Él está pateándome!!
spa	¿Estás seguro?
spa	Entonces tenemos un problema...
spa	¡Ah, allí hay una mariposa!
spa	¡Date prisa!
spa	No me sorprende.
spa	Si yo pudiera ser así...
spa	Por alguna razón, me siento más vivo por la noche.
spa	Eso depende del contexto.
spa	¡¿Acaso te quieres burlar de mí?!
spa	Es la cosa más estúpida que he dicho nunca.
spa	¡¡No quiero ser patético, quiero ser guay!!
spa	Cuando crezca, quiero ser un rey.
spa	América es un lugar encantador para vivir, si estás aquí para ganar dinero.
spa	Estoy tan gordo.
spa	¿Entonces qué?
spa	Voy a pegarle un tiro.
spa	No soy un pez de verdad, sólo soy un peluche.
spa	¡Yo sólo lo digo!
spa	Eso fue probablemente lo que influenció su decisión.
spa	Siempre me he preguntado cómo será tener hermanos.
spa	Esto es lo que yo habría dicho.
spa	Me tomaría una eternidad explicarte todo.
spa	Eso es porque eres una chica.
spa	Algunas veces no puedo evitar mostrar mis sentimientos.
spa	Es una palabra para la que me gustaría encontrar una sustituta.
spa	Eso sería algo que habría que programar.
spa	No tengo la intención de ser egoísta.
spa	Pensemos en lo peor que podría pasar.
spa	¿Cuántos amigos íntimos tienes?
spa	Yo puedo ser antisocial, pero eso no significa que no hable con la gente.
spa	Así ha sido siempre.
spa	Creo que lo mejor es no ser maleducado.
spa	Uno siempre puede encontrar tiempo.
spa	Yo seré infeliz, pero no me suicidaría.
spa	Cuando yo estaba en el instituto me levantaba a las 6 todas las mañanas.
spa	Cuando me desperté estaba triste.
spa	Por fin está más o menos explicado.
spa	Yo pensaba que te gustaba aprender cosas nuevas.
spa	La mayoría de la gente escribe sobre su vida cotidiana.
spa	Si pudiera enviarte un malvavisco, Trang, lo haría.
spa	Para hacer eso, tienes que arriesgarte.
spa	Todas las personas que están solas, están solas porque tienen miedo de los demás.

eng	The road was under construction.
eng	The one who did that wasn't Tom.
eng	The investigation is continuing.
eng	The funding could be inadequate.
eng	The captain's orders were clear.
eng	The audience burst out laughing.
eng	That's what brought us together.
eng	That's something Tom used to do.
eng	That's probably about to change.
eng	That would've been entertaining.
eng	That would've been embarrassing.
eng	That would've been discourteous.
eng	That should get Tom's attention.
eng	That could've been embarrassing.
eng	Some people say I look like Tom.
eng	Some people don't own computers.
eng	Perhaps there are other reasons.
eng	People around here have changed.
eng	Overpopulation is a big concern.
eng	Our products sell well overseas.
eng	Our pricing is very competitive.
eng	Nothing more could've been done.
eng	Not much has changed since then.
eng	Nobody cares about our problems.
eng	Nobody cares about my situation.
eng	No Canadian would ever say that.
eng	Naturally, I was very concerned.
eng	My children were born in Boston.
eng	My blood pressure is quite high.
eng	Meeting Tom has changed my life.
eng	Mary is a very attractive woman.
eng	Let's hope Tom doesn't find out.
eng	It's unclear why Tom isn't here.
eng	It's something we might attempt.
eng	It's naive to believe otherwise.
eng	It's extremely concerning to us.
eng	It's bound to happen eventually.
eng	It's a major tourist attraction.
eng	It caught everybody by surprise.
eng	If Tom is going, I'm going, too.
eng	I've made up my mind to do that.
eng	I'm watching the market closely.

eng	Who wouldn't want to live here?

eng	This isn't likely to change.
eng	This is really bothering me.
eng	This is completely my fault.
eng	This is a complicated issue.
eng	This document is classified.
eng	They're not going to change.
eng	They should've contacted us.
eng	They could've gone anywhere.
eng	There's reason to celebrate.
eng	There's blood on your hands.
eng	There's blood on this knife.
eng	There will be no compromise.
eng	There has been a compromise.
eng	The trail is clearly marked.
eng	The orchestra began to play.
eng	The noise didn't bother Tom.
eng	The movie has already begun.
eng	The gate needs to be closed.
eng	The biggest concern is cost.
eng	The audience began to laugh.
eng	That's none of your concern.
eng	That's how we usually do it.
eng	That's how I was brought up.
eng	That's been made very clear.
eng	That's basically why I came.
eng	That's always a big concern.
eng	That's all they cared about.
eng	That'll bring the cost down.
eng	That would be very exciting.
eng	That woman's very beautiful.
eng	That umbrella belongs to me.
eng	That couldn't be more wrong.
eng	That budget isn't yet final.
eng	Tell us about your new book.
eng	Tell Tom to quit doing that.
eng	So many things have changed.
eng	Security is still a concern.
eng	Sales will continue to grow.
eng	People are afraid of change.
eng	Now you're bringing me down.
eng	Nothing seems to bother Tom.
eng	No one said this would work.
eng	My grandkids live in Boston.
eng	Maybe your luck is changing.
eng	Mary is an attractive woman.
eng	Mary is a very lovely woman.
eng	Make sure you choose wisely.
eng	Listen to me very carefully.
eng	Let's think outside the box.
eng	Let's go visit the Jacksons.
eng	Let's bring our troops home.
eng	Let me introduce Tom to you.
eng	It's already out of control.
eng	It must've been an accident.
eng	It couldn't have been worse.
eng	Is your blood pressure high?
eng	Is it OK if I bring a guest?
eng	Is Tom feeling better today?
eng	I've never had a steady job.
eng	I'm ready for the challenge.
eng	I'm not concerned right now.
eng	I'm not angry at all of you.
eng	I'm hoping that'll continue.
eng	I'm going to miss competing.
eng	I'll still call Boston home.
eng	I wasn't the one who yelled.
eng	I think no one believed Tom.
eng	I think Tom had a good time.
eng	I think Tom didn't trust me.
eng	I suggest you pay attention.
eng	I sometimes dream about Tom.
eng	I saw you flirting with Tom.
eng	I remember that day clearly.
eng	I only have myself to blame.
eng	I know this is my own fault.
eng	I know Tom doesn't love you.
eng	I just couldn't stop myself.
eng	I doubt that'll ever change.
eng	I don't have any complaints.
eng	I don't care about politics.
eng	I don't believe you anymore.
eng	I didn't know Tom back then.
eng	I couldn't even feed myself.
eng	I couldn't do anything else.
eng	I could've done that better.
eng	I consider that a good sign.
eng	I consider myself fortunate.
eng	I complained to the manager.
eng	I can't believe it happened.
eng	I almost got hit by a truck.
eng	I almost became a carpenter.
eng	How will you be celebrating?
eng	How could anyone think that?
eng	Here is a brief explanation.
eng	Here is a brief description.
eng	Has anything really changed?
eng	Everyone is welcome to come.
eng	Don't tell Tom where I live.
eng	Don't pay attention to them.
eng	Don't let Tom use the phone.
eng	Do you want to learn French?

eng	Do you share those concerns?
eng	Do you believe these rumors?
eng	Do you believe in astrology?
eng	Did you see Tom in the park?

eng	Come on, we're running late.
eng	Come on, we're almost there.
eng	Choose your words carefully.
eng	Can you speak French at all?
eng	Call me if anything changes.
eng	Bring your own picnic lunch.
eng	Are we doing this correctly?
eng	Your mother would be proud.
eng	Your analogy isn't correct.
eng	Would this afternoon be OK?
eng	Why wouldn't Tom want that?
eng	Why did the prices go down?
eng	Why are people so careless?
eng	Who would oppose this plan?
eng	Who would buy one of these?

eng	Where will that take place?

eng	What would your mother say?
eng	What else could you expect?
eng	What crime did they commit?
eng	What caused that to happen?
eng	What brought you to Boston?

eng	We're beginning to see why.
eng	We were concerned at first.
eng	We don't have any concerns.
eng	We control our own destiny.
eng	We caught them by surprise.
eng	We can't continue this way.
eng	We can't blame anyone else.

eng	Slaves, though held by the laws of men, are free by the laws of God.
eng	That men should pray and fight for their own freedom, and yet keep others in slavery, is certainly acting a very inconsistent, as well as unjust and, perhaps, impious part.
spa	Ella habla inglés.
eng	Our people had been so long accustomed to the practice and convenience of having slaves, that very few among them even doubted the propriety and rectitude of it.
eng	It is much to be wished that slavery may be abolished. The honour of the States, as well as justice and humanity, in my opinion, loudly call upon them to emancipate these unhappy people. To contend for our own liberty, and to deny that blessing to others, involves an inconsistency not to be excused.
eng	It is too true, however disgraceful it may be to human nature, that nations in general will make war whenever they have a prospect of getting anything by it; nay, absolute monarchs will often make war when their nations are to get nothing by it, but for the purposes and objects merely personal, such as thirst for military glory, revenge for personal affronts, ambition, or private compacts to aggrandize or support their particular families or partisans. These and a variety of other motives, which affect only the mind of the sovereign, often lead him to engage in wars not sanctified by justice or the voice and interests of his people.

eng	I thought you said Tom could win.
eng	Let's drink one more bottle of wine.
eng	Tom didn't get here until after 2:30.

eng	Tom has been asked to do that again.
eng	I'd expected Tom to wait for us.
eng	You could've done that by yourself.
eng	Tom had to get up at 6:30 every day.

eng	Tom doesn't think that we can win.
eng	I hope Tom didn't get injured.
eng	Did you get permission to do that?
eng	Tom doesn't seem to smile anymore.
eng	I hope Tom didn't get annoyed.
eng	Can you still do that by yourself?
eng	Tom doesn't know why I didn't win.
eng	I hear that Tom won't do that.
eng	Can you do that in thirty minutes?
eng	Tom doesn't have to do that again.
eng	I hear Tom sleeps in the nude.
eng	Aren't you glad we didn't do that?
eng	Tom doesn't have the skill to win.
eng	I hear Tom doesn't drink beer.
eng	Are you waiting for me to do that?
eng	Tom doesn't go fishing very often.
eng	I haven't told Tom what to do.
eng	Are you still willing to go there?
eng	Tom does everything I tell him to.
eng	I haven't seen Tom since 2013.
eng	Are you still waiting for the bus?
eng	Tom didn't tell me how to do that.
eng	I have a feeling Tom can swim.
eng	Are you still planning on staying?
eng	Tom didn't seem very busy, did he?
eng	I hadn't intended to hurt Tom.
eng	Are you still enjoying yourselves?
eng	Tom didn't seem to know the truth.
eng	I had a feeling Tom would win.
eng	Are you still doing your homework?
eng	Tom didn't seem to be very scared.
eng	I had a feeling Tom might win.
eng	Are you going to Boston next year?
eng	Tom didn't seem to be too worried.
eng	I got Tom to agree to do that.
eng	Are you all still listening to me?
eng	Tom didn't seem to be sympathetic.
eng	I expected Tom to participate.
eng	Are you actually going to do that?
eng	Tom didn't seem to be ready to go.
eng	I doubt that Tom is still mad.
eng	Are we still allowed to fish here?
eng	Tom didn't seem to be intoxicated.
eng	I doubt Tom will wait for you.
eng	Are these what you're looking for?
eng	Tom didn't seem to be in any pain.
eng	I doubt I can get Tom to swim.
eng	You're still a pilot, aren't you?
eng	Tom didn't seem to be embarrassed.
eng	I didn't think you'd like Tom.
eng	You're still a nurse, aren't you?
eng	Tom didn't seem to be a smart guy.
eng	I didn't know Tom would leave.
eng	You're still a coach, aren't you?
eng	Tom didn't look too worried to me.
eng	I didn't know Tom would dance.
eng	You're probably doing that wrong.
eng	Tom didn't know what he needed do.
eng	I didn't know Tom was worried.
eng	You're hoping to win, aren't you?
eng	Tom didn't have very many options.
eng	I didn't know Tom was nervous.
eng	You were a waitress, weren't you?
eng	Tom didn't have very many friends.
eng	I didn't know Tom was jealous.
eng	You think I could win, don't you?
eng	Tom didn't have time to get bored.
eng	I didn't know Tom was at home.
eng	You think I can't win, don't you?
eng	Tom didn't have anyone to lean on.
eng	I didn't know Tom had noticed.
eng	You still want to win, don't you?
eng	Tom didn't have any classes today.
eng	I came to Boston to visit Tom.
eng	You should've done that yourself.
eng	Tom didn't go to school yesterday.
eng	I bet Tom won't leave on time.
eng	You may leave now if you want to.
eng	Tom didn't do that three days ago.
eng	I asked if Tom had to do that.
eng	You looked like you were worried.
eng	Tom didn't do that all by himself.
eng	I asked Tom to come to Boston.
eng	You looked like you were trapped.
eng	Tom couldn't have done that alone.
eng	I asked Tom to do that on Monday.
eng	You looked like you were shocked.
eng	Tom comes here three times a year.
eng	I advised Tom to learn French.
eng	You looked like you were serious.
eng	Tom claims that he didn't do that.
eng	How often do you eat with Tom?
eng	You looked like you were puzzled.
eng	Tom backed into his parking space.
eng	How do you think Tom will win?
eng	You looked like you were pleased.
eng	Tom back out of his parking space.
eng	How do you know Tom won't win?
eng	You looked like you were nervous.
eng	Tom asked me why I didn't do that.
eng	Everyone did that, except Tom.
eng	You looked like you were jealous.
eng	Tom asked me to stay and help him.
eng	Everybody expected Tom to win.
eng	You looked like you were furious.
eng	Tom asked me if I agreed with him.
eng	Don't let Tom do that anymore.
eng	You looked like you were excited.
eng	Tom and I wanted to sing together.
eng	Does Tom want to do that, too?
eng	You looked like you were curious.
eng	Tom and I sometimes sing together.
eng	Does Tom think he can do that?
eng	You looked like you were certain.
eng	Tom and I often traveled together.
eng	Do you think that Tom can win?
eng	You looked like you were baffled.
eng	Tom and I know you didn't do that.
eng	Do you think Tom will be late?
eng	You looked like you were anxious.
eng	Tom and I have to travel together.
eng	Do you think Tom was confused?
eng	You looked like you were annoyed.
eng	Tom and I don't often leave early.
eng	Do you think Tom is still mad?
eng	You look like you're unimpressed.
eng	Tom and I didn't do that together.
eng	Do you really want Tom to win?
eng	You look like you're discouraged.
eng	Tom and I are doing that together.
eng	Do you really think Tom is OK?
eng	You can run very fast, can't you?
eng	Tom always seems to agree with me.
eng	Do you know why Tom is absent?
eng	You can do that any way you like.
eng	Tom admitted that he wasn't ready.
eng	Do I have to do that with Tom?
eng	Wouldn't it be better to eat now?
eng	Tom admitted that he was homesick.
eng	Did you open the door for Tom?
eng	Will you please pass me the salt?
eng	Tom admitted that he was homeless.
eng	Did Tom say where he did that?
eng	Will you do something about that?
eng	Tom admitted that he was confused.
eng	Did Tom say when he'd do that?
eng	Why don't we all travel together?
eng	Tom wouldn't let me eat anything.
eng	Did Tom say he didn't do that?
eng	Why didn't you do that on Monday?
eng	Tom wouldn't answer my questions.
eng	Did Tom go fishing by himself?
eng	Who's going to eat lunch with us?
eng	Tom would never just let you win.
eng	Could you ask Tom to be quiet?
eng	Which do you think would be best?
eng	Tom won't tell me how to do that.
eng	Could Tom get home by himself?
eng	Where do you usually go swimming?
eng	Tom won't likely stop doing that.
eng	Can you still get Tom to help?
eng	Where do you usually go shopping?
eng	Tom won't let me do that anymore.
eng	Can you still do that for Tom?
eng	Where do you plan to go swimming?
eng	Tom won't be able to win anymore.
eng	Both Tom and I didn't do that.
eng	Where do you plan to go shopping?
eng	Tom will unlikely be able to win.
eng	Are you sure Tom wants to win?
eng	When does will the concert begin?
eng	Tom will never let you win again.
eng	Are you still waiting for Tom?
eng	When and where should we do that?
eng	Tom will get home on Monday, too.
eng	Are you still sure that's Tom?
eng	What're you doing tomorrow night?
eng	Tom will get home back on Monday.
eng	Are you still sure it was Tom?
eng	What would you like to listen to?
eng	Tom went camping three weeks ago.
eng	Are you saying Tom didn't win?
eng	What time does talent show start?
eng	Tom wasn't wounded in the battle.
eng	"Is Tom well?" "No, he isn't."
eng	What day are you going to Boston?
eng	Tom wasn't wounded in the attack.
eng	You hope Tom wins, don't you?
eng	We've decided to travel together.
eng	Tom wasn't told never to do that.
eng	You didn't help Tom, did you?
eng	We're not allowed to eat in here.
eng	Tom wasn't the only person there.
eng	Would Tom really sing for us?
eng	We'd better get home before 2:30.
eng	Tom wasn't the only guy I kissed.
eng	Will Tom get back home today?
eng	We were happy to do that for you.
eng	Tom wasn't the one who helped me.
eng	Why is Tom being so stubborn?
eng	We should've done that last week.
eng	Tom wasn't the one that did that.
eng	Why is Tom always so unlucky?
eng	We should get some more firewood.
eng	Tom wasn't the last one to leave.
eng	Why doesn't Tom want to stay?
eng	We raised our children in Boston.
eng	Tom wasn't sure what to say next.
eng	Why doesn't Tom ever do that?
eng	We probably should sing together.
eng	Tom wasn't at school last Monday.
eng	Why does Tom want me to stay?
eng	We never go water skiing anymore.
eng	Tom wasn't able to win yesterday.
eng	Why did you allow Tom to win?
eng	We have an obligation to do that.
eng	Tom wasn't a member at that time.
eng	Why did Tom do that that way?
eng	We don't travel together anymore.
eng	Tom wasn't a good sport about it.
eng	Who forced Tom to eat a frog?
eng	This painting was very expensive.
eng	Tom was told not to do that here.
eng	Who cares if Tom doesn't win?
eng	This movie is really interesting.
eng	Tom was told he needs to do that.
eng	What's Tom doing with my car?
eng	This isn't an apple. It's a pear.
eng	Tom was told about what happened.
eng	What's Tom doing in the park?
eng	There's an easier way to do that.
eng	Tom was the only one who go hurt.
eng	What did Tom want to show us?
eng	There are only three apples left.
eng	Tom was the one who told me that.
eng	What did Tom want to show me?
eng	That's the way I used to do that.
eng	Tom was supposed to go yesterday.
eng	What did Tom suggest you buy?
eng	That wouldn't have happened here.
eng	Tom was sleeping when I got home.
eng	What did Tom just say to you?
eng	That wasn't an interesting movie.
eng	Tom was going to do that for you.
eng	What did Tom do after dinner?
eng	Should you really be eating that?
eng	Tom was anxious to know the news.
eng	What did Tom cook for dinner?
eng	Please use this pair of slippers.
eng	Tom wants you to do that for him.
eng	We're confident Tom will win.
eng	Please tell me what I have to do.
eng	Tom wanted to win, but he didn't.
eng	Please tell Tom I didn't win.
eng	Please phone me tomorrow morning.
eng	Tom used to win a lot, didn't he?
eng	Please pass this note to Tom.
eng	Please have one of these oranges.
eng	Tom used to stay home on Mondays.
eng	Please give this note to Tom.
eng	Please don't leave the door open.
eng	Tom used to be very good-looking.
eng	Please ask Tom what he'll do.
eng	Please do that any time you want.
eng	Tom tried to get the window open.
eng	Perhaps Tom hasn't done that.
deu	Wer seinem Nachbarn das Hemd stiehlt, stirbt gewöhnlich ohne das eigene.
eng	Please come to my house tomorrow.
eng	Tom tried to get the drawer open.
eng	Let's not ask Tom to do that.
eng	No one else knows how to do that.
eng	Tom told me you wouldn't do that.
eng	Let's go and watch Tom dance.
eng	My grandfather left me this farm.
eng	Tom told me you were able to win.
eng	It's doubtful if Tom can win.
eng	Most people I know enjoy singing.
eng	Tom told me to do that, so I did.
eng	It sounds like Tom is crying.
eng	Maybe you did that the wrong way.
eng	Tom told me that he was ticklish.
eng	It looks like Tom isn't here.
eng	Maybe there's no need to do that.
eng	Tom told me that he was thrilled.
eng	It looks like Tom is worried.
eng	Let's wait until Monday to leave.
eng	Tom told me that he was relieved.
eng	It looks like Tom is puzzled.
eng	Let's all stay at the same hotel.
eng	Tom told me that he was prepared.
eng	It looks like Tom is pleased.
eng	It's probably cold in Boston now.
eng	Tom told me that he was positive.
eng	It looks like Tom is nervous.
eng	It would be safer to go by train.
eng	Tom told me that he was innocent.
eng	It looks like Tom is jealous.
eng	It was cold yesterday, wasn't it?
eng	Tom told me that he was homesick.
eng	It looks like Tom is healthy.
eng	It took me three days to do that.
eng	Tom told me that he was homeless.
eng	It looks like Tom is furious.
eng	It seems that we need to do that.
eng	Tom told me that he was grateful.

eng	It looks like you're unconvinced.
eng	Tom told me that he was flexible.
eng	It looks like Tom is annoyed.
eng	It looks like you're unconcerned.
eng	Tom told me that he was famished.
eng	It looks as if Tom is crying.
eng	Is the post office far from here?
eng	Tom told me that he was divorced.
eng	Is Tom going to swim with us?
eng	If you want to eat that, you may.
eng	Tom told me that he was diabetic.
eng	If Tom does that, I will too.
eng	If we let you do that, would you?
eng	Tom told me that he was agnostic.
eng	I've seen Tom do that before.
eng	If I had more money, I'd do that.
eng	Tom told me he'd do that himself.
eng	I'm surprised Tom didn't win.
eng	I've postponed my trip to Boston.
eng	Tom told me he wasn't sleepy yet.
eng	I'm sure that Tom didn't win.
eng	I've been doing that all my life.
eng	Tom told me he needed some money.
eng	I'm quite sure Tom won't win.
eng	I've been doing that a long time.
eng	Tom told me he needed more money.
eng	I'm pretty sure Tom will win.
eng	I'm thinking of doing that again.
eng	Tom told me he might not do that.
eng	I'm pretty sure Tom will cry.
eng	I'm sure you'll enjoy doing that.
eng	Tom told me he knew who did that.
eng	I'm pretty sure Tom has died.
eng	I'm sure I'll be able to do that.
eng	Tom told me he enjoyed the party.
eng	I'm not sure if Tom can swim.
eng	I'm not sure I can swim that far.
eng	Tom told me he enjoyed the movie.
eng	I'm going to help you do Tom.
eng	I'm moving to Boston next summer.
eng	Tom told me he didn't have a car.
eng	I'm going to do that for Tom.
eng	I'm having a good time in Boston.
eng	Tom thinks he could probably win.
eng	I'm glad that Tom didn't win.
eng	I'm glad we were able to do that.
eng	Tom still doesn't sing very well.
eng	I'm glad Tom was able to win.
eng	I'm doing my French homework now.
eng	Tom sometimes talks in his sleep.
eng	I'm a student, but Tom isn't.
eng	I'm a pretty good French speaker.
eng	Tom should've never tried to win.
eng	I'll meet Tom at the station.
eng	I'm a fairly good French speaker.
eng	Tom should really get some sleep.
eng	I'll have Tom do that for me.
eng	I'll try to get home before 2:30.
eng	Tom should be done eating by now.
eng	I'll get Tom to wait for you.
eng	I'll probably sleep well tonight.
eng	Tom seemed very angry, didn't he?
eng	I'll call Tom Monday evening.
eng	I'll probably be able to do that.
eng	Tom seemed to have recognized me.
eng	I'll ask Tom why he did that.
eng	I'll only be gone for a few days.
eng	Tom seemed to have gained weight.
eng	I'll ask Tom stay for dinner.
eng	I'll never talk about that again.
eng	Tom seemed to have caught a cold.
eng	I'll ask Tom how he did that.
eng	I'll get there as early as I can.
eng	Tom seemed to have been offended.
eng	I'd help if Tom wanted me to.
eng	I'll do that tomorrow. I promise.
eng	Tom seemed to find that annoying.
eng	I wonder why Tom left Boston.
eng	I'll definitely do that sometime.
eng	Tom seemed to be willing to help.
eng	I wonder why Tom isn't ready.
eng	I'll be sure to do that tomorrow.
eng	Tom seemed to be very suspicious.
eng	I wonder why Tom is so upset.
eng	I'd never have done such a thing.
eng	Tom seemed to be very interested.
eng	I wonder why Tom is so tired.
eng	I'd never have agreed to do that.
eng	Tom seemed to be unfazed by that.
eng	I wonder why Tom is so timid.
eng	I'd like to see your new trumpet.
eng	Tom seemed to be reluctant to go.
eng	I wonder why Tom is so drunk.
eng	I'd like to get something to eat.
eng	Tom seemed to be making progress.
eng	I wonder why Tom is so dirty.
eng	I'd have done that if I could've.
eng	Tom seemed to be losing patience.
eng	I wonder why Tom is so angry.
eng	I'd get in trouble if I did that.
eng	Tom seemed to be different today.
eng	I wonder why Tom bought that.
eng	I'd do that myself if I were you.
eng	Tom seemed to be as busy as ever.
eng	I wonder whether Tom can win.
eng	I'd do that myself if I knew how.
eng	Tom seemed quite busy, didn't he?
eng	I wonder what Tom is writing.
eng	I wouldn't mind doing that again.
eng	Tom seemed a little disappointed.
eng	I wonder if Tom isn't hungry.
eng	I would've done that differently.
eng	Tom says he's never won anything.
eng	I wonder if Tom is still shy.
eng	I wonder why you need to do that.
eng	Tom says he'll never leave early.
eng	I wonder if Tom is still sad.
eng	I wonder why you have to do that.
eng	Tom says he'll do that on Monday.
eng	I wonder if Tom is still mad.
eng	I wonder why I shouldn't do that.
eng	Tom says he definitely won't win.
eng	I wonder if Tom is still fat.
eng	I wonder where I need to go next.
eng	Tom saw you fishing last weekend.
eng	I wonder if Tom is a teacher.
eng	I won't be able to do that alone.
eng	Tom said that he intended to win.
eng	I wonder how Tom got so rich.
eng	I won't be able to do that again.
eng	Tom said he's really glad he won.
eng	I went to Boston to meet Tom.
eng	I wish that you'd do that for me.
eng	Tom said he'll never leave early.
eng	I wanted Tom to learn French.
eng	I wish I'd done that before 2:30.
eng	Tom said he'd rather not eat now.
eng	I want Tom to move to Boston.
eng	I went to France to study French.
eng	Tom said he wasn't likely to win.
eng	I want Tom to come to Boston.
eng	I went to Boston three years ago.
eng	Tom said he wasn't likely to cry.
eng	I told you Tom would do that.
eng	I wasn't injured in the accident.
eng	Tom said he wanted to try to win.
eng	I told you Tom could do that.
eng	I wasn't impressed by what I saw.
eng	Tom said he thought he could win.
eng	I told Tom to wash his hands.
eng	I wasn't at the party last night.
eng	Tom said he should've left early.
eng	I told Tom to get some sleep.

eng	Tom said he may agree to do that.
eng	I told Tom I was from Boston.
eng	I wasn't able to finish my lunch.
eng	Tom said he knew he wouldn't win.
eng	I thought that Tom could win.
eng	I was reading a novel last night.
eng	Tom said he figured he could win.
eng	I thought Tom was having fun.
eng	I was in Boston three months ago.
eng	Tom said he didn't want you here.
eng	I thought Tom had to do that.
eng	I was in Boston for three months.
eng	Tom said he didn't want to sleep.
eng	I think even Tom can do that.
eng	I wanted to get home before 2:30.
eng	Tom said he didn't want to fight.
eng	I think Tom is still worried.
eng	I want you to do that in October.
eng	Tom said he didn't want me to go.
eng	I think Tom is still outside.
eng	I tried to do that that way once.
eng	Tom said he didn't play baseball.
eng	I think Tom is still nervous.
eng	I thought we could sing together.
eng	Tom said he didn't need to hurry.
eng	I think Tom is still married.
eng	I think you're overly optimistic.
eng	Tom said he didn't need anything.
eng	I think Tom is still curious.
eng	I think you're likely to be late.
eng	Tom said he didn't need a lawyer.
eng	I sure hope Tom will do that.
eng	I think you're a really nice kid.
eng	Tom said he can't sing very well.
eng	I sure hope Tom doesn't that.
eng	I think you'd better leave early.
eng	Tom said I shouldn't leave early.
eng	I sure hope Tom doesn't lose.
eng	I think you'd be able to do that.
eng	Tom really should get some sleep.
eng	I promised Tom that I'd wait.
eng	I think you should do that later.
eng	Tom rarely ever sleeps past 6:30.
eng	I often go shopping with Tom.
eng	I think we shouldn't leave early.
eng	Tom probably won't do that alone.
eng	I know what Tom wanted to do.
eng	I think we should try doing that.
eng	Tom probably didn't buy anything.
eng	I know what Tom needed to do.
eng	I think we can do that this week.
eng	Tom probably did that on purpose.
eng	I know both of Tom's sisters.
eng	I think that you're being unfair.
eng	Tom only asked me three questions.
eng	I know Tom won't wait for us.
eng	I think that won't be easy to do.
eng	Tom never seems to smile anymore.
eng	I know Tom will probably cry.
eng	I think all of us should do that.
eng	Tom needs to do that pretty soon.
eng	I know Tom has to leave soon.
eng	I think I'd better do that today.
eng	Tom needs to do that immediately.
eng	I know Tom agreed to do that.
eng	I think I should do that for you.
eng	Tom must've run all the way home.
eng	I knew what Tom wanted to do.
eng	I talked to the waiter in French.
eng	Tom must've really wanted to win.
eng	I knew what Tom needed to do.
eng	I swear I'll never do that again.
eng	Tom might not laugh at that joke.
eng	I knew that Tom wouldn't win.
eng	I suppose I can do that tomorrow.
eng	Tom looks like he's disappointed.
eng	I knew that Tom couldn't win.
eng	I suggest you do that right away.
eng	Tom looked like he was uncertain.
eng	I knew Tom wouldn't eat that.
eng	I suggest you do that in October.
eng	Tom looked like he was terrified.
eng	I knew Tom wouldn't buy that.
eng	I suggest that you eat right now.
eng	Tom looked like he was surprised.
eng	I knew Tom wouldn't be there.
eng	I studied French for three years.

eng	I knew Tom wanted to do that.
eng	I saw three children in the park.
eng	Tom looked like he was plastered.
eng	I just can't believe Tom won.
eng	I returned from Boston yesterday.
eng	Tom looked like he was miserable.
eng	I hope that Tom waits for us.
eng	I really thought I could do that.
eng	Tom looked like he was irritated.
eng	I hope Tom is waiting for us.
eng	I probably won't do that anymore.
eng	Tom looked like he was impressed.
eng	I hope Tom didn't get scared.
eng	I never thought I'd see you here.
eng	Tom looked like he was impatient.
eng	I hope Tom agrees to do that.
eng	I needed to get home before 2:30.
eng	Tom looked like he was horrified.
eng	I hope Tom agreed to do that.
eng	I need to buy some fishing hooks.
eng	Tom looked like he was exhausted.
eng	I heard that Tom is stubborn.
eng	I might need to do that with you.
eng	Tom looked like he was disgusted.
eng	I hear that Tom will do that.
eng	I made up my mind not to do that.
eng	Tom looked like he was desperate.
eng	I hear Tom doesn't drink tea.
eng	I lived in the suburbs of Boston.
eng	Tom looked like he was depressed.
eng	I haven't reimbursed Tom yet.
eng	I lived in Boston for many years.
eng	Tom looked like he was contented.
eng	I have a feeling Tom can win.
eng	I know you haven't done that yet.
eng	Tom looked like he was confident.
eng	I found Tom a French teacher.
eng	I know I shouldn't be doing this.
eng	Tom looked like he was concerned.
eng	I doubt that Tom is still up.
eng	I knew you'd have fun doing that.
eng	Tom knows who's going to do that.
eng	I don't know what Tom buried.
eng	I knew you wouldn't want to sing.
eng	Tom knows we aren't going to win.
eng	I don't believe Tom will win.
eng	I knew you wouldn't get punished.
eng	Tom knows that I'm not going win.
eng	I don't believe Tom will cry.
eng	I knew we wouldn't find anything.
eng	Tom knows that I hardly ever win.
eng	I didn't know Tom would come.
eng	I knew we should've left earlier.
eng	Tom knows that I don't often win.
eng	I didn't know Tom was so old.
eng	I just don't think I can do that.
eng	Tom knows I can't wait that long.
eng	I didn't know Tom was sleepy.
eng	I intend to keep my old computer.
eng	Tom knows I can't sing very well.
eng	I didn't know Tom was scared.
eng	I hope you don't make me do that.

eng	I haven't written the letter yet.
eng	Tom kept waiting for three hours.

eng	I haven't worked in three months.
eng	Tom isn't wearing a blue sweater.
eng	I didn't know Tom needed one.
eng	I haven't watered the garden yet.
eng	Tom isn't usually home on Monday.
eng	I can't order Tom to do that.
eng	I haven't paid for my ticket yet.
eng	Tom isn't using crutches anymore.
eng	I can do that, but Tom can't.
eng	I haven't made much progress yet.

eng	Let's go ahead and do that now.
eng	Tom told me he was very hungry.
eng	Did Tom say he didn't win?
eng	Let me show you how we do that.
eng	Tom told me he was unconvinced.
eng	Are you sure Tom will win?
eng	It's fun to go out in the rain.
eng	Tom told me he was sympathetic.
eng	You should let Tom leave.
eng	It rains a lot here in October.

eng	What's Tom doing up here?
eng	It looked like you were asleep.
eng	Tom told me he needed our help.
eng	What's Tom doing in here?
eng	Is there still time to do that?

eng	What did Tom think of it?
eng	I've won a free trip to Boston.
eng	Tom told me he liked the movie.
eng	What did Tom have to eat?
eng	I've never used a winch before.
eng	Tom told me he knows the rules.
eng	We should make Tom leave.
eng	I've never used a lathe before.
eng	Tom told me he knew what to do.
eng	We all hope Tom can swim.
eng	I've just returned from Boston.
eng	Tom told me he knew how I felt.
eng	They say Tom can do that.
eng	I've gotten used to doing that.
eng	Tom told me he intended to win.
eng	Perhaps Tom is in Boston.
eng	I've been here since yesterday.
eng	Tom told me he found something.
eng	It looks like Tom is shy.
eng	I've been doing that for years.
eng	Tom told me he didn't eat pork.
eng	It looks like Tom is out.
eng	I've always done this this way.
eng	Tom told me he didn't eat meat.
eng	Is what Tom told me true?
eng	I've always done that that way.
eng	Tom told me he did that for us.

eng	Tom told me he could handle it.
eng	I'm glad that Tom waited.
eng	I'm sorry I waited for so long.
eng	Tom threatened me with a knife.
eng	I'll visit Tom in Boston.
eng	I'm not sure who paid the bill.
eng	Tom thinks he can probably win.
eng	I'll ask Tom wait for us.
eng	I'm not interested in baseball.
eng	Tom takes good care of himself.
eng	I wonder why Tom is here.
eng	I'm not going to be doing that.
eng	Tom still can't sing very well.
eng	I wonder if Tom will cry.
eng	I'm no longer living in Boston.
eng	Tom stays with us every summer.
eng	I wonder if Tom has died.
eng	I'm likely to sleep until noon.
eng	Tom stayed in Boston last year.
eng	I wonder how Tom got wet.
eng	I'm in my room studying French.
eng	Tom shouldn't have bought that.
eng	I told you Tom would win.
eng	I'm going to college in Boston.
eng	Tom should get back home today.
eng	I told you Tom could win.
eng	I'm glad I was able to do that.
eng	Tom seems to have already left.
eng	I told Tom that I'd wait.
eng	I'm a native speaker of French.
eng	Tom seems to be very surprised.
eng	I think that Tom can swim.
eng	I'll only stay for a few hours.
eng	Tom seems to be very satisfied.
eng	I think Tom was grateful.
eng	I'll help you if you want me to.
eng	Tom seemed to have disappeared.
eng	I think Tom is still mad.
eng	I'll do that tomorrow for sure.
eng	Tom seemed to have been crying.
eng	I taught Tom some French.
eng	I'll do that again if I had to.
eng	Tom seemed to enjoy being here.
eng	I sure hope Tom will win.
eng	I'll definitely try to do that.
eng	Tom seemed to be very confused.
eng	I sure hope Tom can swim.
eng	I'll be in Boston next weekend.
eng	Tom seemed to be uncomfortable.
eng	I spoke to Tom in French.
eng	I'd stop smoking if I were you.
eng	Tom seemed to be tired tonight.
eng	I spoke to Tom in Boston.
eng	I'd rather not wait any longer.
eng	Tom seemed to be quite relaxed.
eng	I should ask Tom to wait.
eng	I'd rather not go home tonight.
eng	Tom seemed to be getting angry.
eng	I ordered Tom to do that.
eng	I'd never have let that happen.
eng	Tom seemed to be conscientious.
eng	I needed to wait for Tom.
eng	I'd never allow you to do that.
eng	Tom seemed to be concentrating.
eng	I met Tom at the station.
eng	I'd never allow that to happen.
eng	Tom seemed to be a little down.
eng	I know that Tom can swim.

eng	Tom seemed slightly distracted.
eng	I knew Tom wouldn't lose.
eng	I'd do that if you asked me to.
eng	Tom seemed hesitant to do that.
eng	I knew Tom had done that.
eng	I'd do that if I had more time.
eng	Tom seemed happier than before.
eng	I hoped Tom wouldn't win.
eng	I'd do that for you if I could.
eng	Tom seemed a little distracted.
eng	I hope that Tom can swim.
eng	I'd do it myself if I were you.
eng	Tom says he'll leave on Monday.
eng	I hope Tom doesn't snore.
eng	I wonder why I have to do that.
eng	Tom says he hopes that you win.
eng	I hope Tom didn't notice.
eng	I wonder who'll do that for us.
eng	Tom said that he'd like to win.
eng	I hate it when Tom cries.
eng	I wonder how we should do that.
eng	Tom said he's eating lunch now.
eng	I had Tom do that for me.
eng	I wish you'd wait a bit longer.
eng	Tom said he'd get home by 2:30.
eng	I doubt that Tom can win.
eng	I wasn't wearing a life jacket.
eng	Tom said he won't sing tonight.
eng	I didn't want Tom to win.
eng	I wasn't the first person here.
eng	Tom said he thought I was lazy.
eng	I didn't know Tom saw us.
eng	I wasn't surprised by the news.

eng	I wasn't expecting any of this.
eng	Tom rarely ever smiles anymore.
eng	How did Tom actually win?
eng	I wasn't dressed appropriately.
eng	Tom rarely ever agrees with me.
eng	How can Tom possibly win?
eng	I wasn't at church last Sunday.
eng	Tom probably won't win anymore.
eng	Don't let Tom drink beer.
eng	I wasn't able to pass the test.
eng	Tom ought to wait a bit longer.
eng	Don't be deceived by Tom.
eng	I wasn't able to pass the exam.
eng	Tom ought to learn how to swim.
eng	Does Tom want to go, too?
eng	I wasn't able to open the safe.
eng	Tom never really wanted to win.
eng	Does Tom want to eat now?
eng	I wasn't able to defend myself.
eng	Tom never goes fishing anymore.
eng	Does Tom play the guitar?
eng	I was very ambitious back then.

eng	Are you sure Tom can win?
eng	I walk to school every morning.
eng	Tom looks like he's interested.
eng	"How's Tom?" "He's fine."
eng	I usually drink tea with meals.
eng	Tom looks like he's frustrated.
eng	You can't let Tom leave.
eng	I used to stay home on Mondays.
eng	Tom looks like he's frightened.
eng	Will Tom leave tomorrow?
eng	I used to do that all the time.
eng	Tom looks like he's displeased.
eng	Why shouldn't Tom leave?
eng	I think you can easily do that.
eng	Tom looks like a sumo wrestler.
eng	Why does Tom never swim?
eng	I think you can do that better.
eng	Tom looked like he was worried.

eng	What's Tom planning now?
eng	I speak French fairly fluently.
eng	Tom looked like he was curious.
eng	What's Tom going to eat?
eng	I shouldn't be doing this here.
eng	Tom looked like he was certain.
eng	What did you do for Tom?

eng	I really can't wait any longer.
eng	Tom left right after breakfast.
eng	We all hope Tom can win.
eng	I passed my French examination.
eng	Tom knows who wants to do that.
eng	They called the boy Tom.
eng	I need to get home before 2:30.
eng	Tom knows who needs to do that.
eng	That's why Tom did that.
eng	I nearly did that this morning.
eng	Tom isn't well-known in Boston.
eng	That's how Tom did that.
eng	I might go to Boston next fall.
eng	Tom isn't wearing his new coat.
eng	That's Tom's dictionary.

eng	I know that Tom can win.
eng	I haven't done anything so far.
eng	Tom is going to take that risk.
eng	I know how Tom did that.
eng	I haven't done a whole lot yet.

deu	Jedermann wünscht lange zu leben, aber niemand wünscht alt zu werden.
eng	Tom bet me I couldn't do that.
eng	I got Tom to laugh.
eng	I haven't cooked the eggs yet.
eng	Tom asked me why I left early.
eng	How far did Tom go?
eng	I haven't closed the door yet.
eng	Tom asked me where I did that.
eng	Don't make Tom cry.
eng	I haven't been in Boston long.
eng	Tom asked me if I'd done that.
eng	Does Tom like jazz?
eng	I haven't been home in a week.
eng	Tom apparently didn't do that.
eng	Didn't Tom do that?
eng	I haven't been happy recently.
eng	Tom and I never sing together.
eng	Can we rely on Tom?
eng	I haven't been a teacher long.
eng	Tom and I might sing together.
eng	Why's Tom smiling?
eng	I have to get back home today.
eng	Tom and I know who left early.
eng	Why's Tom leaving?
eng	I have to do that by tomorrow.
eng	Tom and I could sing together.
eng	Why is Tom sleepy?
eng	I have to do that before 2:30.
eng	Tom and I are trying our best.
eng	Why is Tom single?
eng	I had to get home before 2:30.
eng	Tom always seems to be crying.
eng	Why is Tom lonely?
eng	I had intended to go swimming.
eng	Tom admitted that he was lazy.
eng	Why is Tom absent?
eng	I grew up just outside Boston.
eng	Tom admitted that he was cold.
eng	Who went with Tom?
eng	I gave each boy three dollars.
eng	Tom's house is near the park.
eng	Who made Tom sing?
eng	I don't write letters anymore.
eng	Tom wouldn't understand this.
eng	Where did Tom eat?
eng	I don't think I'd like Boston.
eng	Tom wouldn't understand that.
eng	When did Tom sing?
eng	I don't often sleep on planes.
eng	Tom wouldn't help us do that.
eng	What's Tom making?
eng	I don't have to do that again.
eng	Tom wouldn't be here tonight.
eng	What's Tom buying?
eng	I didn't think you'd eat that.
eng	Tom wouldn't ask you to sing.
eng	What's Tom baking?
eng	I didn't think you'd buy that.
eng	Tom won't like it if you win.
deu	Mir ist gerade richtig langweilig.
eng	The girl I wanted to marry married someone else.
eng	The girl I wanted to marry married somebody else.
eng	What's Tom asking?
eng	I didn't think you'd be ready.
eng	Tom won't ever do that again.
eng	What made Tom cry?
eng	I didn't think you'd be first.
eng	Tom will win sooner or later.
eng	What did Tom sell?
eng	I didn't know you'd come back.
eng	Tom will win again, I'm sure.
eng	What did Tom hide?
eng	I didn't know you were so old.
eng	Tom will probably be starved.
eng	What did Tom drop?
eng	I didn't know you were sleepy.
eng	Tom will likely win tomorrow.
eng	What did Tom draw?
eng	I didn't know you were scared.
eng	Tom will get home by himself.
eng	What did Tom cook?
eng	I didn't know you were lonely.
eng	Tom will get back home today.
eng	What did Tom bury?
eng	I didn't know you were afraid.
eng	Tom went at school yesterday.
eng	We saw Tom crying.
eng	I didn't know it would matter.
eng	Tom wasn't worried about you.
eng	Maybe Tom can win.
eng	I didn't know it was possible.
eng	Tom wasn't working part-time.
eng	May I go with Tom?
eng	I didn't know I'd get injured.
eng	Tom wasn't wearing a sweater.
eng	Let's let Tom win.
eng	I didn't go sailing yesterday.
eng	Tom wasn't wearing a red tie.
eng	Let's go with Tom.
eng	I didn't do that just for you.
eng	Tom wasn't wearing a new hat.
eng	Let's contact Tom.
eng	I didn't do that just for fun.
eng	Tom wasn't wearing a costume.
eng	Is this Tom's cup?
eng	I did that as fast as I could.
eng	Tom wasn't very affectionate.
eng	Is Tom an officer?
eng	I decided not to go to Boston.
eng	Tom wasn't the only one hurt.
eng	I'll ask Tom wait.
eng	I decided not do that anymore.
eng	Tom wasn't the last to leave.
eng	I'd never hit Tom.
eng	I couldn't get home by myself.
eng	Tom wasn't talking about you.
eng	I think Tom cried.
eng	I could tell you who did that.
eng	Tom wasn't sure he could win.
eng	I saw Tom smiling.
eng	I can't tell you who did that.
eng	Tom wasn't busy at that time.
eng	I saw Tom outside.
eng	I can't stand people like you.
eng	Tom wasn't a baseball player.
eng	I played with Tom.
eng	I can't find our box of fuses.
eng	Tom was too young to do that.
eng	How could Tom win?
eng	I can tell you how to do that.
eng	Tom was told he couldn't win.
eng	Even Tom can swim.
eng	I can sing a few French songs.
eng	Tom was doing that for hours.
eng	Don't let Tom win.
eng	I can see mountains from here.
eng	Tom was able to do that, too.
eng	Does Tom eat beef?
eng	I can hardly speak any French.
eng	Tom wants to be a lumberjack.
eng	Why's Tom crying?
eng	I bought three pairs of shoes.
eng	Tom wanted to get some sleep.
eng	Why is Tom naked?
eng	I believe that we can do that.
eng	Tom vowed he'd never do that.
eng	Why is Tom broke?
eng	I'll be in Boston until tomorrow.
eng	Tom uses bricks for bookends.
eng	Why is Tom angry?
eng	How long did the typhoon last?
eng	Tom used to win all the time.
eng	Why is Tom alone?
eng	How long did the concert last?
eng	Tom used to enjoy eating out.
eng	Who made Tom cry?
eng	Have you read all these books?
eng	Tom used to be conscientious.
eng	Who arrested Tom?
eng	Do you watch TV every evening?
eng	Tom tried really hard to win.
eng	We know Tom left.
eng	Do you think I should do that?
eng	Tom told me you wouldn't win.
eng	Perhaps Tom left.
eng	Do you really want to eat now?
eng	Tom told me you wouldn't cry.
eng	Isn't Tom hungry?
eng	Do you know how that happened?
eng	Tom told me that he was safe.
eng	Is Tom a teacher?
eng	Do you intend to eat all that?
eng	Tom told me that he was rich.
eng	I'll let Tom win.
eng	Do you guys ever eat together?
eng	Tom told me that he was poor.
eng	I made Tom leave.
eng	Did you go anywhere yesterday?
eng	Tom told me that he was next.
eng	I heard Tom sing.
eng	Did you find out who did that?
eng	Tom told me that he was lost.
eng	I got Tom to wait
eng	Could I borrow your saxophone?
eng	Tom told me that he was lazy.
eng	Have Tom do that.
eng	Could I ask you for some help?
eng	Tom told me that he was glad.
eng	Even Tom laughed.
eng	Come and look at what I found.
eng	Tom told me that he was full.
eng	Doesn't Tom swim?
eng	Can you still touch your toes?
eng	Tom told me that he was free.
eng	Didn't Tom smile?
eng	Can you still make it on time?
eng	Tom told me that he was done.
eng	Ask Tom to smile.
eng	Can you still help me do that?
eng	Tom told me that he was cold.
eng	Ask Tom to leave.
eng	Can you still fly an airplane?
eng	Tom told me he'd wait for us.
eng	Why is Tom busy?
eng	Can you come tomorrow morning?
eng	Tom told me he'd sort it out.
eng	Why did Tom win?
eng	Can we still get there by car?
eng	Tom told me he wouldn't wait.
eng	Is that man Tom?
eng	Can I borrow a pair of pliers?
eng	Tom told me he wasn't coming.
eng	Is that guy Tom?
eng	Are you still willing to help?
eng	Tom told me he was very busy.
eng	Is that boy Tom?
eng	Are you still taking pictures?
eng	Tom told me he was skeptical.
eng	Is Tom a doctor?
eng	Are you still making progress?
eng	Tom told me he was irritated.
eng	I went with Tom.
eng	Are you still listening to me?
eng	Tom told me he was in Boston.
eng	I made Tom wait.
eng	Are you still having problems?
eng	Tom told me he was exhausted.
eng	I made Tom stay.
eng	Are you still going to school?
eng	Tom told me he was done, too.
eng	I made Tom sing.
eng	Are you still going to Boston?
eng	Tom told me he was desperate.
eng	I let Tom leave.
eng	Are you still getting married?
eng	Tom told me he was depressed.
eng	How did Tom win?
eng	Are you still doing all right?
eng	Tom told me he was concerned.
eng	How can Tom win?
eng	Are you still being sarcastic?
eng	Tom told me he was at school.
eng	Didn't Tom sing?
eng	Are you still a bachelor, too?
eng	Tom told me he was an artist.
eng	Can Tom go, too?
eng	Are you good at playing chess?
eng	Tom told me he wanted to win.
eng	Ask Tom to stay.
eng	All of your goldfish are dead.
eng	Tom told me he wanted to die.
eng	Ask Tom to sing.
eng	"How did that go?" "Not well."
eng	Tom told me he wanted to cry.
eng	Why is Tom shy?
eng	You're not a waiter, are you?
eng	Tom told me he might not win.
eng	Why is Tom mad?
eng	You're not a tailor, are you?
eng	Tom told me he liked my idea.
eng	I let Tom sing.
eng	You're not a farmer, are you?
eng	Tom told me he felt offended.
eng	Hug Tom for me.
eng	You're not a doctor, are you?
eng	Tom told me he didn't get it.
eng	Even Tom cried.
eng	You're not a barber, are you?
eng	Tom told me he couldn't walk.
eng	Didn't Tom win?
eng	You'd better do that quickly.
eng	Tom told me he couldn't wait.
eng	Didn't Tom cry?
eng	You should be a veterinarian.
eng	Tom told me he could take it.
eng	Can't Tom swim?
eng	You probably won't win today.
eng	Tom told me he could help us.
eng	Will Tom sing?
eng	You looked like you were wet.
eng	Tom told me he could do that.
eng	Only Tom left.
eng	You looked like you were sad.
eng	Tom told me he called the police.
eng	Does Tom sing?
eng	You looked like you were mad.
eng	Tom told me he believed that.
eng	Did Tom smile?
eng	You looked like you were hot.
eng	Tom told me I did that wrong.
eng	Let Tom sing.
eng	You look like you're worried.
eng	Tom thinks you can't do that.
eng	Did Tom run?
eng	You look like you're wealthy.
eng	Tom thinks that we can't win.
eng	It would've probably been better if Tom hadn't told Mary that he'd spent three years in prison.
eng	You look like you're trapped.
eng	Tom sometimes agrees with me.
eng	I told Tom that I thought Mary was in Boston, but he said that he thought Mary was in Chicago.
eng	You look like you're through.
eng	Tom sleeps eight hours a day.
eng	Tom warned Mary what might happen if she ate the mushrooms John had found in the woods.
eng	You look like you're puzzled.
eng	Tom seems to come every week.
eng	Tom wouldn't be stupid enough to eat the mushrooms Mary found in the woods, would he?
eng	You look like you're pleased.
eng	Tom seemed unable to do that.
eng	Tom wanted to go to Boston with us, but Mary said she wouldn't go if he went with us.
eng	You look like you're nervous.
eng	Tom seemed to like you a lot.
eng	Tom lets Mary sing with his band sometimes, even though she's not a very good singer.
eng	You look like you're jealous.
eng	Tom seemed to know the truth.
eng	Tom didn't seem very surprised when he heard that Mary and John had gotten married.
eng	You look like you're healthy.
eng	Tom seemed to know his stuff.
eng	Even though Tom promised not to drink anymore, he's at the bar drinking with Mary.
eng	You look like you're dubious.
eng	Tom seemed to have recovered.
eng	Tom said Mary was going to go the day before yesterday, but he didn't have time.
eng	You look like you're curious.
eng	Tom seemed to be very scared.
eng	Tom would never forgive you if you ate all the cookies that he baked for Mary.
eng	You look like you're certain.
eng	Tom seemed to be very lonely.
eng	Tom didn't seem to know that Mary didn't do what she said she was going to do.
eng	You look like you're annoyed.
eng	Tom seemed to be very afraid.
eng	I expect that Tom will wait until Mary gets there before he starts doing that.
eng	You didn't do that very well.
eng	Tom seemed to be unperturbed.
eng	Tom knew Mary was the one who had done that, even though she said she didn't.
eng	You didn't do that correctly.
eng	Tom seemed to be unimpressed.
eng	Tom and Mary couldn't do that by themselves, so they asked John to help them.
eng	You aren't a barber, are you?
eng	Tom seemed to be unconvinced.
eng	Tom was the only other person who didn't eat any of the salad that Mary made.
eng	Would you mind if I don't go?
eng	Tom seemed to be unconscious.
eng	Tom probably shouldn't have told Mary that he'd spent three years in prison.
eng	Would you ever eat a hamster?
eng	Tom seemed to be unconcerned.
eng	Tom wasn't the one who convinced Mary that she should learn how to do that.
eng	Will you go to Boston by car?
eng	Tom seemed to be trustworthy.
eng	Tom said he thought Mary needed at least $300 to buy everything she needed.
eng	Why does that make you angry?
eng	Tom seemed to be sympathetic.
eng	Tom told me that he thought Mary would be quicker at doing that than John.
eng	Why does it matter who knows?
eng	Tom seemed to be really busy.
eng	Tom told me he didn't know why Mary didn't do what she was supposed to do.
eng	Why did you agree to do that?
eng	Tom seemed to be ready to go.
eng	Tom isn't the one who convinced Mary that she should learn how to do that.
eng	Who told you I was in Boston?
eng	Tom seemed to be quite upset.
eng	Tom didn't seem to know that Mary hadn't done what she was supposed to do.
eng	Which of you ate my sandwich?
eng	Tom seemed to be quite happy.
eng	Tom told me that he thought Mary would be ready by the time we got there.
eng	Where did you swim yesterday?
eng	Tom seemed to be pretty rich.
eng	Tom and Mary spent a lot of time together when they were both in college.
eng	Where are you going tomorrow?
eng	Tom seemed to be pretty busy.
eng	Tom and Mary didn't know how to do that, so they asked John to help them.
eng	What time do you want to eat?
eng	Tom seemed to be pessimistic.
eng	Tom told me that he thought Mary would be gone by the time we got there.
eng	What kind of car did you buy?
eng	Tom seemed to be overwhelmed.
eng	Tom told me that he thought Mary was glad that that was going to happen.
eng	What kind of bait do you use?
eng	Tom seemed to be nice enough.
eng	Tom and Mary won't know whether they can do that or not unless they try.
eng	What else do you want to buy?
eng	Tom seemed to be intoxicated.
eng	Didn't you know Tom used to win every time he played chess against Mary?
eng	What does that remind you of?
eng	Tom seemed to be intelligent.
eng	Tom is the one who convinced Mary that she should learn how to do that.
eng	What does that actually mean?
eng	Tom seemed to be incompetent.
eng	Tom didn't seem very surprised when I told him that Mary had left town.
eng	What did you do after dinner?
eng	Tom seemed to be heartbroken.
eng	Tom can play the guitar well, but Mary can play the guitar much better.
eng	We're going to that together.
eng	Tom seemed to be happy again.
eng	I wonder whether Tom has ever asked Mary why she dropped out of school?
eng	We're going to do that again.
eng	Tom seemed to be embarrassed.
eng	Tom told me that he thought Mary would be finished doing that by 2:30.
eng	We'll be doing that together.
eng	Tom seemed to be disoriented.
eng	Tom told me he didn't know why Mary didn't do what she should've done.
eng	We won't get back home today.
eng	Tom seemed to be discouraged.
eng	Tom told Mary that she didn't have to eat anything she didn't want to.
eng	We won't do that without you.
eng	Tom seemed to be daydreaming.
eng	Tom told Mary that John wouldn't eat the stew if it had carrots in it.
eng	We wanted to travel together.
eng	Tom seemed to be comfortable.
eng	Last year, Tom wasn't as fat as Mary, but now he's fatter than she is.
eng	We thought you could do that.
eng	Tom seemed to be celebrating.
eng	I wonder why Tom waited so long before he told Mary what had happened.
eng	We shouldn't do that anymore.
eng	Tom seemed to be a smart guy.
eng	Tom would've been going now if Mary hadn't done it for him yesterday.
eng	We should get some more food.
eng	Tom seemed to always be busy.
eng	Tom told me that he thought Mary would be present at today's meeting.
eng	We need to decide what to do.
eng	Tom seemed surprisingly calm.
eng	Tom told Mary that she didn't have to do anything she didn't want to.
eng	We don't have any water left.
eng	Tom seemed somewhat confused.
eng	Tom says it makes no difference to him whether Mary does that or not.
eng	We don't have any more water.
eng	Tom seemed slightly confused.
eng	Tom says he used to win all the time when he played tennis with Mary.
eng	We do that a lot at my house.
eng	Tom seemed reluctant to help.
eng	Tom said he thought Mary needed at least $300 to buy what she needed.
eng	We can't get back home today.
eng	Tom seemed like a decent kid.
eng	Tom isn't the only one who didn't know that Mary had moved to Boston.
eng	We can't do that without you.
eng	Tom seemed extremely excited.
eng	Tom and Mary got married just after they both graduated from college.
eng	We already know you did that.
eng	Tom seemed different somehow.
eng	Tom and Mary don't often win when playing tennis with John and Alice.
eng	Today I get off work at 2:30.
eng	Tom seemed a little hesitant.
eng	Tom wasn't surprised that Mary already knew about what had happened.
eng	This room isn't large enough.
eng	Tom says he's heard you sing.
eng	Tom thought Mary might not want to do that on a cold day like today.
eng	This movie isn't interesting.
eng	Tom says he'll do that again.
eng	Tom says Mary will stay with her grandparents in Boston next summer.
eng	This is a pear, not an apple.
eng	Tom says he doesn't ever win.
eng	I think Tom will eventually give up and ask Mary to do that for him.
eng	There's no way I can do that.
eng	Tom said he's not doing that.
eng	Tom wasn't the one who convinced Mary to teach John how to do that.
eng	Please show me around Boston.
eng	Tom said he'd definitely win.
eng	Tom told me that he thought Mary would be interested in doing that.
eng	Please let me do the washing.
eng	Tom said he wouldn't help me.
eng	Tom told Mary that she should stop eating at fast food restaurants.
eng	Please hand me the newspaper.
eng	Tom said he was unlikely win.
eng	Tom and Mary will have to ask John to do that for them, won't they?
eng	Please do that a little more.
eng	Tom said he was going to win.
eng	Tom went to warn Mary not to eat the mushrooms John had collected.
eng	Please come on the twentieth.
eng	Tom said he felt like crying.
eng	Tom wasn't the one who convinced Mary to show John how to do that.
eng	Please come at half past two.
eng	Tom refused to work overtime.
eng	Tom was hoping he could persuade Mary to go to the dance with him.
eng	My wife and I live in Boston.
eng	Tom promised he wouldn't cry.
eng	Tom told me that he thought that what Mary had done was unethical.
eng	May I use your phone, please.
eng	Tom probably won't win today.
eng	Tom told me that he thought Mary would be the next one to do that.
eng	May I go to the zoo tomorrow?
eng	Tom probably won't win again.
eng	Tom says that he waited for a long time, but Mary never showed up.
eng	May I borrow this dictionary?
eng	Tom probably cried yesterday.
eng	Tom said he thought he wouldn't enjoy going skin diving with Mary.
eng	Let's do this somewhere else.
eng	Tom plans to wait until 2:30.
eng	Tom said he doesn't think Mary really had to go yesterday morning.
eng	It's the only way to do that.
eng	Tom only does that on Monday.
eng	Tom isn't the one who convinced Mary to teach John how to do that.
eng	It'll take about three hours.
eng	Tom may leave if he wants to.
eng	Tom is the only one who didn't know that Mary had moved to Boston.
eng	It was yesterday that I went.
eng	Tom may have to leave school.
eng	Tom is going to eventually despise Mary, just like the rest of us.
eng	It looks like you're worried.
eng	Tom looks tempted to do that.
eng	Tom has been waiting for Mary in front of the library all morning.
eng	It looks like you're puzzled.
eng	Tom looks like he's relieved.
eng	I'm fairly certain that Tom has already talked to Mary about that.
eng	It looks like you're pleased.
eng	Tom looks like he's prepared.
eng	I heard from Tom that Mary gets home just after 2:30 every Monday.
eng	It looks like you're nervous.
eng	Tom looks like he's offended.
eng	I don't think Tom knows where Mary bought the dress she's wearing.
eng	It looks like you're excited.
eng	Tom looks like he's homeless.
eng	Tom wasn't the only one who didn't know Mary had moved to Boston.
eng	It looks like you're curious.
eng	Tom looks like he's hesitant.
eng	Tom wasn't the only one in the room who didn't notice Mary leave.
eng	It looks like you're annoyed.
eng	Tom looks like he's finished.
eng	Tom told me that he thought Mary was difficult to get along with.
eng	It looks as if it might rain.
eng	Tom looks like he's confused.
eng	Tom told me that he thought Mary was amused by what was going on.
eng	It looked like you were dead.
eng	Tom looked like he was upset.
eng	Tom told me that he thought Mary didn't know how to speak French.
eng	It looked like you were busy.
eng	Tom looked like he was tense.
eng	Tom said that he had a stomachache after eating what Mary cooked.
eng	It isn't much fun to do that.
eng	Tom looked like he was sorry.
eng	Tom isn't the one who convinced Mary to show John how to do that.
eng	Is it OK if I don't eat this?
eng	Tom looked like he was ready.
eng	Tom didn't seem to be surprised that Mary wasn't able to do that.
eng	If you want to stay, you may.
eng	Tom looked like he was drunk.
eng	Tom didn't seem to be surprised that Mary didn't know what to do.
eng	If I can do that, so can you.
eng	Tom looked like he was dizzy.
eng	Tom didn't know how to do that, so he asked Mary to show him how.
eng	I've read all of these books.
eng	Tom looked like he was awake.
eng	Tom and Mary were sure they wouldn't be allowed to do that again.
eng	I've never swum in this lake.
eng	Tom looked like he was angry.
eng	Tom and Mary told me that they have never played tennis together.
eng	I've lost my French textbook.
eng	Tom looked like he was alone.
eng	If Tom hadn't helped Mary, she'd never have been able to do that.
eng	I've just decided to do that.
eng	Tom looked like he was alive.
eng	Tom would never forgive us if we ate the cake he baked for Mary.
eng	I'm teaching at a university.
eng	Tom likely won't wait for us.
eng	Tom wondered why Mary didn't want to eat what he'd made for her.
eng	I'm supposed to go to Boston.
eng	Tom knows why you left early.
eng	Tom wasn't the one who told Mary that her house had burned down.
eng	I'm supposed to be in Boston.
eng	Tom knows who has to do that.
eng	Tom wasn't sure Mary didn't know she wasn't supposed to do that.
eng	I'm sorry I made you do that.
eng	Tom knows I wouldn't do that.
eng	Tom thought Mary might want to do that early tomorrow afternoon.
eng	I'm sorry I left without you.
eng	Tom knew that I wouldn't win.
eng	Tom thought Mary might be allowed to do that in the near future.
eng	I'm sorry I couldn't do that.
eng	Tom knew that I wouldn't cry.
eng	Tom said he thought he wouldn't enjoy going to Boston with Mary.
eng	I'm not scared of the police.
eng	Tom isn't worried about that.
eng	Tom said he thought Mary needed to do that before John got here.
eng	I'm not happy here in Boston.
eng	Tom isn't willing to help us.
eng	Tom said he thought Mary might not be required to do that again.
eng	I'm in Boston for a whole week.
eng	Tom isn't wearing a swimsuit.
eng	Tom said he doesn't think Mary wanted to go yesterday afternoon.
eng	I'm going to do that for you.
eng	Tom isn't waiting for anyone.
eng	Tom isn't the only one in the room who didn't notice Mary leave.
eng	I'm getting better at French.
eng	Tom isn't very likely to cry.
eng	Neither Tom nor Mary plans to go to Boston with us next weekend.
eng	I'm expecting you to do that.
eng	Tom isn't a very humble person.
eng	I wonder what made Tom think that Mary was the one who did that?
eng	I'm doing my French homework.
eng	Tom isn't too tired to study.
eng	Tom wasn't a bit surprised by how well Mary could speak French.
eng	I'm convinced we can do that.
eng	Tom isn't the only one there.
eng	Tom told me that he thought Mary would be reluctant to do that.
eng	I'll tell you how to do that.
eng	Tom isn't the one who hit me.
eng	Tom thought he heard Mary snoring in the back of the classroom.
eng	I'll go to Boston in October.
eng	Tom isn't likely to ever win.
eng	Tom said he thought Mary needed to do that as soon as possible.
eng	I'll do that some other time.
eng	Tom isn't a church-going man.
eng	Tom said Mary isn't sure whether John can take care of himself.
eng	I'll do that in my free time.
eng	Tom is wrong about that, too.
eng	Tom isn't the one who told Mary that her house had burned down.
eng	I'll buy you a cup of coffee.
eng	Tom is very kind to everyone.
eng	Tom isn't sure Mary didn't know she wasn't supposed to do that.
eng	I'll be in Boston next month.
eng	Tom is too sleepy to do that.
eng	Tom is the one who convinced Mary to teach John how to do that.
eng	I'll be in Boston all summer.
eng	Tom is the only person there.
eng	Tom and I were speaking in French when Mary came into the room.
eng	I'll be going to Boston soon.
eng	Tom is the one who's winning.
eng	I think Tom should tell Mary that he can't really speak French.
eng	I'll be back on October 20th.
eng	Tom is the one that did that.
eng	I don't think Tom would've done that if Mary hadn't been there.
eng	I'd never go there by myself.
eng	Tom is terribly disappointed.
eng	Don't forget to tell Mary that she has to get home before 2:30.
eng	I'd like you to do that, too.
eng	Tom is supposed to come soon.
eng	Tom wasn't the one who convinced Mary to learn how to do that.
eng	I'd help if you wanted me to.
eng	Tom is probably still sleepy.
eng	Tom was going to go to Boston to see Mary, but decided not to.
eng	I'd better leave early today.
eng	Tom is probably still scared.
eng	Tom told me that he thought Mary was the first one to do that.
eng	I'd better do that right now.
eng	Tom is probably still lonely.
eng	Tom told me that he thought Mary had studied French with John.
eng	I'd be a fool not to do that.
eng	Tom is probably still grumpy.
eng	Tom thought Mary might not be permitted to do that by herself.
eng	I went to the mall yesterday.
eng	Tom is probably still crying.
eng	Tom should've told Mary that she was doing that the wrong way.
eng	I went to Boston on business.
eng	Tom is probably still afraid.
eng	Tom seemed to only start having fun after Mary left the party.
eng	I went to Boston last winter.
eng	Tom is probably going to win.
eng	Tom is the one who convinced Mary to show John how to do that.
eng	I went there to learn French.
eng	Tom is probably going to cry.
eng	Tom is planning to wait until Mary gets here before he leaves.
eng	I wasn't sure how to respond.
eng	Tom is likely to wait for us.
eng	Tom complained of a stomachache after eating what Mary cooked.
eng	I wasn't even here yesterday.
eng	Tom is hoping you'll do that.
eng	Tom and Mary got divorced three months after they got married.
eng	I wasn't aware of the danger.
eng	Tom is expected to come soon.
eng	Tom wondered how Mary managed to eat everything on her plate.
eng	I wasn't at school on Monday.
eng	Tom is accustomed to winning.
eng	Tom wasn't sure Mary didn't know she was supposed to do that.
eng	I was tired after doing that.
eng	Tom is a little disappointed.
eng	Tom told me that he thought Mary was the last one to do that.
eng	I was irritated by the noise.
eng	Tom hasn't ever won anything.
eng	Tom told me that he thought Mary might be tempted to do that.
eng	I was in Boston last weekend.
eng	Tom has told me he won't win.
eng	Tom told me that he thought Mary didn't want to go to Boston.
eng	I was hoping I'd get a raise.
eng	Tom has told me he can't win.
eng	Tom told me that Mary had been injured in a traffic accident.
eng	I was born in Boston in 2013.
eng	Tom has eaten dinner already.
eng	Tom thought Mary might not be required to do that by herself.
eng	I was able to see the doctor.
eng	Tom has been told to go home.
eng	Tom said he's not sure whether Mary can take care of herself.
eng	I wanted to eat Chinese food.
eng	Tom has been smiling all day.
eng	Tom said he doesn't think Mary really needs to do that again.
eng	I wanted to do some shopping.
eng	Tom has always wanted to win.
eng	Tom said Mary knew John might not stay in Boston much longer.
eng	I wanted to be ready by 2:30.
eng	Tom doesn't think you'll win.
eng	Tom isn't the one who convinced Mary to learn how to do that.
eng	I used to sleep on the floor.
eng	Tom doesn't think you'll cry.
eng	Tom is the only one in the room who didn't notice Mary leave.
eng	I used to often go to Boston.
eng	Tom doesn't think we can win.
eng	Tom has probably despised Mary for as long as he's known her.
eng	I told you you could do that.
eng	Tom doesn't think I can swim.
eng	Tom and Mary will have to do that even if they don't want to.
eng	I thought it was an accident.
eng	Tom doesn't seem to eat much.
eng	I saw Tom and Mary walking together in the park this morning.
eng	I thought I'd get some sleep.
eng	Tom doesn't laugh very often.
eng	Tom wasn't the one who showed Mary how to tie a square knot.
eng	I thought I told you to wait.
eng	Tom doesn't care how you win.
eng	Tom wasn't surprised that Mary caught more fish than he did.
eng	I think you're likely to win.
eng	Tom doesn't believe I'll win.
eng	Tom told Mary that she should quit eating so much fast food.
eng	I think you're a good leader.
eng	Tom does that more than I do.
eng	Tom thought Mary might not be allowed to do that by herself.
eng	I think you're a good father.
eng	Tom died in Boston last year.
eng	Tom thought Mary might be permitted to do that next weekend.
eng	I think you're a good driver.
eng	Tom didn't think I could win.
eng	Tom should tell Mary that she doesn't need to do that again.
eng	I think you'd better do that.
eng	Tom didn't seem very worried.
eng	Tom should tell Mary that she doesn't have to do that again.
eng	I think we can do that again.
eng	Tom didn't seem very sincere.
eng	Tom isn't sure Mary didn't know she was supposed to do that.
eng	I suggest you get some sleep.
eng	Tom didn't seem very nervous.
eng	Tom is the one who told Mary that her house had burned down.
eng	I studied French for a while.
eng	Tom didn't seem very excited.
eng	Tom is sure Mary didn't know she wasn't supposed to do that.
eng	I stayed overnight in Boston.
eng	Tom didn't seem to like that.
eng	Tom doesn't spend as much time studying French as Mary does.
eng	I spent the summer in Boston.
eng	Tom didn't seem to be sleepy.
eng	Tom didn't seem to be convinced that Mary wanted to do that.
eng	I speak French to my parents.
eng	Tom didn't seem to be scared.
eng	Tom didn't seem to be convinced that Mary needed to do that.
eng	I sold my house for $300,000.
eng	Tom didn't seem to be lonely.
eng	Tom and Mary never should've tried doing that by themselves.
eng	I should've never left early.
eng	Tom didn't seem to be asleep.
eng	I don't think Tom knows for certain when Mary will get here.
eng	I should do that before 2:30.
eng	Tom didn't seem to be afraid.
eng	I don't think Tom and Mary have ever played tennis together.
eng	I see no point in doing that.
eng	Tom didn't seem tired at all.
eng	According to Tom, Mary isn't going to go to Boston with him.
eng	I saw no point in doing that.
eng	Tom didn't seem disappointed.
eng	Tom would like you to show Mary how to eat with chopsticks.
eng	I returned to Boston in 2013.
eng	Tom didn't look very hopeful.
eng	Tom wasn't the only man at the company that Mary respected.
eng	I read a book while I waited.
eng	Tom didn't look very healthy.
eng	Tom told me that he thought Mary was determined to do that.
eng	I plan to go home by himself.
eng	Tom didn't know how to begin.
eng	Tom told me that he thought Mary was a talented songwriter.
eng	I ought to go back to Boston.
eng	Tom didn't have many options.
eng	Tom thought Mary might not be permitted to do that anymore.
eng	I never should've left early.
eng	Tom didn't have any shoes on.
eng	Tom thought Mary might have to stay in Boston until Monday.
eng	I need to find it in a hurry.
eng	Tom didn't do that willingly.
eng	Tom should've waited until Mary got there to before I left.
eng	I need to buy some tent pegs.
eng	Tom didn't do that last year.
eng	Tom should tell Mary that he doesn't want to do that again.
eng	I need three hundred dollars.
eng	Tom did that single-handedly.
eng	Tom says he's despised Mary since the first day he met her.
eng	I might wait a little longer.
eng	Tom came to see me yesterday.
eng	Tom said he'd expected Mary to stay in Boston until Monday.
eng	I might not wait much longer.
eng	Tom came to Boston last year.
eng	Tom said he thought Mary needed to do that before she left.
eng	I might need to do that soon.
eng	Tom believes that he can win.
eng	Tom said he might sing with Mary and her band next weekend.
eng	I might have to do that soon.
eng	Tom asked me when I did that.
eng	Tom said Mary thought John might not need to do that again.
eng	I might go surfing next week.
eng	Tom asked me if I left early.
eng	Tom isn't the one who showed Mary how to tie a square knot.
eng	I lived in Boston until 2013.
eng	Tom apparently wanted to win.
eng	Tom is willing to do that, but Mary said he didn't need to.
eng	I lied about being in Boston.
eng	Tom and I've never done that.
eng	Tom is willing to do that, but Mary said he didn't have to.
eng	I know you needed to do that.
eng	Tom and I'll travel together.
eng	Tom is too busy worrying about Mary to worry about himself.
eng	I know who agreed to do that.
eng	Tom almost agreed to do that.
eng	Tom didn't seem to be having a good time talking with Mary.
eng	I knew you'd want to do that.
eng	Tom wouldn't do that either.
eng	Tom didn't seem surprised when I told him Mary wasn't here.
eng	I knew you'd need to do that.
eng	Tom won't likely try to win.
eng	Tom didn't seem surprised that Mary wasn't able to do that.
eng	I knew you'd like doing that.
eng	Tom won't let you win again.
eng	Tom didn't seem surprised that Mary didn't know what to do.
eng	I knew you'd have to do that.
eng	Tom won't bother us anymore.
eng	Tom and Mary shouldn't have tried doing that by themselves.
eng	I knew you'd enjoy the party.
eng	Tom won't be waiting for us.
eng	I wonder whether Tom has ever asked Mary why she got fired?
eng	I knew you wouldn't be there.
eng	Tom will unlikely win today.
eng	I don't think Tom knows what Mary wants him to buy for her.
eng	I knew you wouldn't be fired.
eng	Tom will probably win today.
eng	Didn't you know that Tom was going to go fishing with Mary?
eng	I knew you wouldn't be awake.
eng	Tom will probably win again.
eng	We used Tom's truck to move Mary's piano to her new house.
eng	I knew you wanted to do that.
eng	Tom will probably never win.
eng	Tom wasn't the one who broke the windshield of Mary's car.
eng	I knew it wasn't an accident.
eng	Tom will never leave Boston.
eng	Tom was the only person who ate the dessert that Mary made.
eng	I knew I wouldn't busy today.
eng	Tom will get mad if you win.
eng	Tom told me that he thought Mary was desperate to do that.
eng	I intend to return to Boston.
eng	Tom will definitely not win.
eng	Tom thought Mary might not be required to do that anymore.
eng	I hope you don't get injured.
eng	Tom will be with me all day.
eng	Tom thought Mary might be permitted to do that by herself.
eng	I hope to leave next weekend.
eng	Tom went to the post office.
eng	Tom said he thought Mary needed to do that sometime today.
eng	I hope to be back in October.
eng	Tom went to the county fair.
eng	Tom said Mary thought she might not need to do that again.
eng	I heard noises in the garage.
eng	Tom went to Boston for work.
eng	Tom said Mary doesn't think John can take care of himself.
eng	I heard about that in Boston.
eng	Tom wasn't wrong about that.
eng	Tom probably won't be able to do that without Mary's help.
eng	I haven't washed the car yet.
eng	Tom wasn't wearing a tuxedo.
eng	Tom is the one who convinced Mary to learn how to do that.
eng	I haven't read this book yet.
eng	Tom wasn't wearing a jacket.
eng	Tom didn't seem to want to do that any more than Mary did.
eng	I haven't read that book yet.
fra	Rien n'est constant dans ce monde que l'inconstance.
eng	Tom wasn't very resourceful.
eng	Tom and I'll have to ask Mary to do that for us, won't we?
eng	I haven't ordered dinner yet.
eng	Tom wasn't very considerate.
eng	Tom admitted that he didn't really know where Mary worked.
eng	I haven't opened the box yet.
eng	Tom wasn't there, was he?
eng	Neither Tom nor Mary wanted to visit John in the hospital.
eng	I haven't figured it out yet.
eng	Tom wasn't there that night.
eng	It's too bad that Tom didn't ask Mary to help him do that.
eng	I haven't eaten anything yet.
eng	Tom wasn't the only witness.
eng	I wonder what made Tom think Mary will be able to do that?
eng	I haven't decided what to do.
eng	Tom wasn't surprised either.
eng	I wonder what made Tom think Mary doesn't need to do that?
eng	I haven't been home all week.
eng	Tom wasn't much of a talker.
eng	I wonder what made Tom think Mary doesn't have to do that?
eng	I haven't been here recently.
eng	Tom wasn't making any sense.
eng	I don't think Tom knows who Mary went to the concert with.
eng	I haven't been eating enough.
eng	Tom wasn't in a joking mood.
eng	I don't think Tom knows what Mary is supposed to be doing.
eng	I haven't been busy recently.
eng	Tom wasn't happy about this.
eng	I don't think Tom knows that Mary shouldn't be doing that.
eng	I have to get home on Monday.
eng	Tom wasn't fighting, was he?
eng	Do you think Tom is still quicker at doing that than Mary?
eng	I have to get home by Monday.
eng	Tom wasn't enjoying himself.
eng	Do you really think Tom is better at doing that than Mary?
eng	I have things I've got to do.
eng	Tom wasn't breaking the law.
eng	Did you know that Tom was going to go to Boston with Mary?
eng	I have something else to say.
eng	Tom wasn't being nice to me.
eng	Tom will be talking to Mary about that when he gets here.
eng	I had to do that before 2:30.
eng	Tom wasn't altogether wrong.
eng	Tom wasn't the only one who saw Mary sneak into the room.
eng	I had a lot of fun in Boston.
eng	Tom wasn't afraid of anyone.
eng	Tom wasn't the only one who could've stolen Mary's money.
eng	I get home every day at 2:30.
eng	Tom wasn't a French teacher.
eng	Tom wasn't the one who taught Mary how to ride a bicycle.
eng	I found a good job in Boston.
eng	Tom was willing to help you.
eng	Tom wasn't the one who suggested that I go out with Mary.
eng	I flew to Boston last Monday.
eng	Tom was too weak to do that.
eng	Tom wasn't the one who convinced Mary to stop doing that.
eng	I find that noise irritating.
eng	Tom was supposed to do that.
eng	Tom wasn't the one who convinced Mary to quit doing that.
eng	I feel like eating right now.
eng	Tom was single all his life.
eng	Tom told me that he thought Mary would be home on Monday.
eng	I enjoyed last night's party.
eng	Tom was nearly hit by a car.
eng	Tom told me that he thought Mary was smarter than he was.
eng	I drink coffee every morning.
eng	Tom was killed by the enemy.
eng	Tom told me that he thought Mary was hesitant to do that.
eng	I don't usually use a pillow.
eng	Tom was hoping we'd do that.
eng	Tom thought Mary might not be permitted to do that again.
eng	I don't think I can eat that.
eng	Tom was hoping he could win.
eng	Tom thought Mary might not be allowed to do that anymore.
eng	I don't know who that guy is.
eng	Tom was having a lot of fun.
eng	Tom thought Mary might be required to do that by herself.
eng	I don't know how old you are.
eng	Tom was finally able to win.
eng	Tom said he was hoping he and Mary could travel together.
eng	I don't have time to eat now.
eng	Tom was a college professor.
eng	Tom said he thought Mary might not need to do that again.
eng	I don't drink beer every day.
eng	Tom warned me you might cry.
eng	Tom said he thought Mary might not have to do that again.
eng	I do that three times a year.
eng	Tom used to win quite often.
eng	Tom said he expected Mary to stay in Boston until Monday.
eng	I dislike waiting for people.
eng	Tom used to swim quite well.
eng	Tom isn't the only man at the company that Mary respects.
eng	I didn't think you'd be busy.
eng	Tom told us he wouldn't cry.
eng	Tom isn't the one who broke the windshield of Mary's car.
eng	I didn't really go to Boston.
eng	Tom told us he couldn't win.
eng	Tom has advised me not to go mountain climbing with Mary.
eng	I didn't know you'd be early.
eng	Tom told me that he'd cried.
eng	Tom didn't seem to be convinced that Mary had to do that.
eng	I didn't know you'd be alone.
eng	Tom told me that he was shy.
eng	Tom and Mary promised me that they'd never do that again.
eng	I didn't know you were upset.
eng	Tom told me that he was sad.
eng	Tom admitted that he didn't really know where Mary lived.
eng	I didn't know you needed one.
eng	Tom told me that he was mad.
eng	Neither Tom nor Mary lived in Boston when they were kids.
eng	I didn't know we'd need that.
eng	Tom told me that he was hot.
eng	I wonder what made Tom think Mary didn't want to do that?
eng	I didn't know I had a choice.
eng	Tom told me not to eat this.
eng	I wonder what made Tom think Mary didn't need to do that?
eng	I didn't eat all the cookies.
eng	Tom told me he'd try to win.
eng	I wonder what made Tom think Mary didn't have to do that?
eng	I didn't do that voluntarily.
eng	Tom told me he'd look at it.
eng	I wonder if Tom is still quicker at doing that than Mary.
eng	I did well on my French test.
eng	Tom told me he'd likely cry.
eng	I think we should let Tom and Mary do that by themselves.
eng	I did that while I was drunk.
eng	Tom told me he wouldn't win.
eng	I think that Tom doesn't know that Mary can speak French.
eng	I definitely need to do that.
eng	Tom told me he wouldn't cry.
eng	I knew Tom wouldn't be able to keep Mary from doing that.
eng	I definitely need a vacation.
eng	Tom told me he wasn't upset.
eng	I don't think Tom knows where Mary usually goes swimming.
eng	I definitely have to do that.
eng	Tom told me he wasn't tired.
eng	I don't think Tom knows where Mary usually goes shopping.
eng	I currently live near Boston.
eng	Tom told me he wasn't sorry.
eng	I don't think Tom could've done that without Mary's help.
eng	I can't paint as well as you.
eng	Tom told me he wasn't happy.
eng	Tom won't likely want to go mountain climbing with Mary.
eng	I can't find a place to park.
eng	Tom told me he wasn't bored.
eng	Tom wasn't the only one who didn't laugh at Mary's joke.
eng	I can't believe you said yes.
eng	Tom told me he wasn't angry.
eng	Tom wasn't surprised to see John and Mary out on a date.
eng	I can't believe you ate that.
eng	Tom told me he wasn't alone.
eng	Tom wasn't able to get Mary to understand what he meant.
eng	I can sing some French songs.
eng	Tom told me he was worn out.
eng	Tom was the one who advised Mary to eat more vegetables.
eng	I can also speak some French.
eng	Tom told me he was unbiased.
eng	Tom told us he wouldn't eat the stew that Mary had made.
eng	I believe that I can do that.
eng	Tom told me he was ticklish.
eng	Tom told me that he was quicker at doing that than Mary.
eng	I assume that we can do that.
eng	Tom told me he was prepared.
eng	Tom told me that he thought Mary was through doing that.
eng	I almost didn't wait for you.
eng	Tom told me he was mistaken.
eng	Tom told me that he thought Mary had been irresponsible.
eng	I admit I've never done that.
eng	Tom told me he was grateful.
eng	Tom told me that he thought Mary had been disrespectful.
eng	How would you have done that?
eng	Tom told me he was finished.
eng	Tom thought Mary might be allowed to do that by herself.
eng	How much time will that take?
eng	Tom told me he was confused.
eng	Tom says he expects Mary to stay in Boston until Monday.
eng	How much time does that take?
eng	Tom told me he was a doctor.
eng	Tom said he'll probably go shopping with Mary on Monday.
eng	How much did that watch cost?
eng	Tom told me he wants to win.
eng	Tom said Mary has only gone hiking with him three times.
eng	How long ago did that happen?
eng	Tom told me he wants to die.
eng	Tom knew Mary did that, even though she said she didn't.
eng	Have you ever been on a ship?
eng	Tom told me he wanted to go.
eng	Tom isn't the only one who saw Mary sneak into the room.
eng	Don't force me do that again.
eng	Tom told me he tried to win.
eng	Tom isn't the only one who could've stolen Mary's money.
eng	Does it rain a lot in Boston?
eng	Tom told me he needed money.
eng	Tom isn't the one who taught Mary how to ride a bicycle.
eng	Do you want to sing together?
eng	Tom told me he isn't hungry.
eng	Tom isn't the one who suggested that I go out with Mary.
eng	Do you use aftershave lotion?
eng	Tom told me he felt seasick.
eng	Tom isn't the one who convinced Mary to stop doing that.
eng	Do you often have to do that?
eng	Tom told me he didn't smoke.
eng	Tom isn't the one who convinced Mary to quit doing that.
eng	Do you know where the dog is?
eng	Tom told me he didn't do it.
eng	Tom is the one who showed Mary how to tie a square knot.
eng	Do you know how to use an ax?
eng	Tom told me he didn't agree.
eng	Tom didn't seem surprised when he saw Mary kissing John.
eng	Do you have any blue scarves?
eng	Tom told me he could fix it.
eng	Tom and Mary won't be able to do that without your help.
eng	Do you buy lots of magazines?
eng	Tom told me he ate too much.
eng	Tom and Mary will despise John as much as I do, I think.
eng	Did you remember to buy eggs?
eng	Tom thought I might not win.
eng	Tom and Mary tried to do that, but they weren't able to.
eng	Did you go bowling yesterday?
eng	Tom thinks that we can swim.
eng	Tom and Mary probably didn't travel together very often.
eng	Couldn't you do that, please?
eng	Tom talked about his school.
eng	Tom and Mary have to do something they don't want to do.
eng	Can't you do that any faster?
eng	Tom should've waited for us.
eng	Tom and Mary got married when they were still teenagers.
eng	Can you still ride a bicycle?
eng	Tom seems to have done that.
eng	Tom and I'll go fishing with Mary and John next weekend.
eng	Can you still move your legs?
eng	Tom seems to be unconcerned.
eng	I think Tom can't leave until Mary gives him some money.
eng	Can you still do that for me?
eng	Tom seemed totally confused.
eng	I showed Tom the letter that Mary had written in French.
eng	Can you still do a handstand?
eng	Tom seemed to think so, too.
eng	I hope Tom tells Mary that he can't really speak French.
eng	Can you do that more quickly?
eng	Tom seemed to recognize you.
eng	I don't think Tom was expecting Mary to do that for him.
eng	Can we do that before Monday?
eng	Tom seemed to be very tense.
eng	I don't think Tom knows why Mary dropped out of college.
eng	Aren't you going eat with us?
eng	Tom seemed to be very naive.
eng	I don't think Tom knows whether Mary can do that or not.
eng	Are you still in charge here?
eng	Tom seemed to be unfriendly.
eng	I don't think Tom knows where Mary learned how to drive.
eng	Are you still afraid of dogs?
eng	Tom seemed to be successful.
eng	I don't think Tom knows when Mary will leave for Boston.
eng	Are you still a teacher here?
eng	Tom seemed to be quite busy.
eng	I don't think Tom knows the reason Mary is absent today.
eng	Are you still a student here?
eng	Tom seemed to be pretty mad.
eng	I don't think Tom knows if Mary wants to do that or not.
eng	Are you going to go swimming?
eng	Tom seemed to be optimistic.
eng	I don't think Tom knows exactly when Mary will get home.
eng	You're not a coach, are you?
eng	Tom seemed to be mesmerized.
eng	I don't think Tom and Mary have ever done that together.
eng	You won't need that anymore.
eng	Tom seemed to be interested.
eng	I don't think Tom and Mary go swimming together anymore.
eng	You shouldn't be eating now.
eng	Tom seemed to be in trouble.
eng	Does Tom really win every time he plays chess with Mary?
eng	You ought to get some sleep.
eng	Tom seemed to be frustrated.
eng	Tom wondered if anyone despised Mary as much as he did.
eng	You may not do that anymore.
eng	Tom seemed to be fascinated.
eng	Tom wasn't the one who taught Mary how to ride a horse.
eng	You make juggling look easy.
eng	Tom seemed to be doing well.
eng	Tom wasn't surprised that Mary already knew what to do.
eng	You look like you're scared.
eng	Tom seemed to be doing fine.
eng	Tom wasn't a bit surprised by how well Mary could swim.
eng	You look like you're lonely.
eng	Tom seemed to be distressed.
eng	Tom told me that he intended to go to Boston with Mary.
eng	You look like you're hungry.
eng	Tom seemed to be distraught.
eng	Tom told Mary that Alice wasn't his girlfriend anymore.
eng	You look like you're afraid.
eng	Tom seemed to be distracted.
eng	Tom thought Mary might not be allowed to do that again.
eng	You know I wouldn't do that.
eng	Tom seemed to be displeased.
eng	Tom seemed to be convinced that Mary wanted to do that.
eng	You can sing if you want to.
eng	Tom seemed to be devastated.
eng	Tom seemed to be convinced that Mary needed to do that.
eng	You aren't a pilot, are you?
eng	Tom seemed to be determined.
eng	Tom said he'd probably go shopping with Mary on Monday.
eng	Would you mind coming early?
eng	Tom seemed to be busy today.
eng	Tom said he was hoping he and Mary could sing together.
eng	Why does that matter anyway?
eng	Tom seemed to be bewildered.
eng	Tom knew Mary wouldn't be able to get home before 2:30.
eng	Who went with you yesterday?
eng	Tom seemed to be astonished.
eng	Tom isn't the only one who didn't laugh at Mary's joke.
eng	Who else would've done that?
eng	Tom seemed to be a nice guy.
eng	Tom is upset because he wasn't invited to Mary's party.
eng	Who else might've done that?
eng	Tom seemed to be OK with it.
eng	Tom is the only boy that Mary has invited to her party.
eng	Who else could've done that?
eng	Tom seemed to agree with us.
eng	Tom didn't know that Mary had intended to go yesterday.
eng	Who do you usually eat with?
eng	Tom seemed like a great kid.
eng	Tom asked Mary if she really thought she could do that.
eng	Where in Australia were you?
eng	Tom seemed like a great guy.
eng	Tom and Mary never should've tried doing that together.
eng	When do you expect to start?
eng	Tom seemed interested in me.
eng	Tom and Mary couldn't have done that without your help.
eng	When did you win this award?
eng	Tom seemed happy to be here.
eng	I wonder why Tom is so quicker at doing that than Mary.
eng	What month is your birthday?
eng	Tom seemed a little worried.
eng	I wonder why Tom didn't want to go to Boston with Mary.
eng	What else do you need to do?
eng	Tom seemed a little nervous.
eng	I don't think Tom knows why Mary dropped out of school.
eng	What else do you have to do?
eng	Tom seemed a little annoyed.
eng	I don't think Tom knows why Mary and John are fighting.
eng	What did you see last night?

eng	Tom told me he'd walk home.
eng	Tom and Mary had hoped John could do that for them.
eng	Do we need to do that again?
eng	Tom told me he'd try again.
eng	Tom and Mary don't want to walk home by themselves.
eng	Did I give you enough money?
eng	Tom told me he'd stay home.
eng	Neither Tom nor Mary plan to study music in Boston.
eng	Can you do that on your own?
eng	Tom told me he'd been sick.
eng	I wonder what made Tom think Mary wouldn't do that?
eng	Can you buy a ticket for me?
eng	Tom told me he'd been busy.
eng	I wonder what made Tom think Mary ought to do that?
eng	Both of us ought to do that.
eng	Tom told me he wasn't sure.
eng	I wonder what made Tom think Mary needs to do that?
eng	Are you still a taxi driver?
eng	Tom told me he wasn't sick.
eng	I wonder what made Tom think Mary hasn't done that?
eng	Any one of us could do that.
eng	Tom told me he was wounded.
eng	I wonder what made Tom think Mary couldn't do that?
eng	An awful thing has happened.
eng	Tom told me he was unlucky.
eng	I think Tom shouldn't tell Mary about the accident.
eng	All the kids are doing that.
eng	Tom told me he was unhappy.
eng	I think Tom could've done that without Mary's help.
eng	You're not expected to win.
eng	Tom told me he was starved.
eng	I heard from Tom that Mary doesn't do that anymore.
eng	You should've left earlier.
eng	Tom told me he was retired.
eng	I don't think Tom knows why Mary doesn't like dogs.
eng	You should be a politician.
eng	Tom told me he was puzzled.
eng	I don't think Tom knows why Mary called the police.
eng	You should be a pharmacist.
eng	Tom told me he was pleased.
eng	I don't think Tom knows what Mary wants him to say.
eng	You seem to be unimpressed.
eng	Tom told me he was nervous.
eng	I don't think Tom knows what Mary wants him to buy.
eng	You look like you're upset.
eng	Tom told me he was jealous.
eng	I don't think Tom knows what Mary expects from him.
eng	You look like you're tense.
eng	Tom told me he was healthy.
eng	I don't think Tom knows that Mary wants to do that.
eng	You look like you're ready.
eng	Tom told me he was furious.
eng	I don't think Tom knows that Mary needs to do that.
eng	You look like you're angry.
eng	Tom told me he was excited.
eng	I don't think Tom knows that Mary doesn't like him.
eng	You look like you're alone.
eng	Tom told me he was curious.
eng	I don't think Tom knows Mary isn't very happy here.
eng	You could've waited longer.
eng	Tom told me he was at home.
eng	I don't think Tom knows Mary can understand French.
eng	Would I be able to do that?
eng	Tom told me he was annoyed.
eng	I don't think Tom has met either of Mary's sisters.
eng	Won't you stay for a while?
eng	Tom told me he was adopted.
eng	I don't think Tom has as many friends as Mary does.
eng	Why don't you do that, too?
eng	Tom told me he walked home.
eng	I don't think Tom has any idea what Mary has to do.
eng	Why don't we sing together?
eng	Tom told me he liked pizza.
eng	I don't think Tom has any friends here except Mary.
eng	Why can't you just do that?
eng	Tom told me he had a knife.
eng	I didn't know Tom was going to ask Mary to do that.
eng	Why can't we do that again?
eng	Tom told me he felt hungry.
eng	I didn't know Tom had already told Mary what to do.
eng	Why are you doing that now?
eng	Tom told me he felt better.
eng	Did you know that Tom and Mary often sing together?
eng	Which do you think is best?
eng	Tom told me he didn't know.
eng	You should tell Tom Mary can take care of herself.
eng	Where's the subway station?
eng	Tom told me he could do it.
eng	Tom wasn't the one who told Mary where John lived.
eng	Where will you go tomorrow?
eng	Tom told me I'd likely win.
eng	Tom wasn't the first person to offer to help Mary.
eng	Where do you usually study?
eng	Tom told me I couldn't win.
eng	Tom wasn't surprised that Mary complained so much.
eng	Where do you intend to eat?
eng	Tom thinks you can do that.
eng	Tom wasn't able to talk Mary out of marrying John.
eng	Where did you go on Monday?
eng	Tom thinks that we can win.
eng	Tom told me yesterday that Mary would go tomorrow.
eng	When would you like to eat?
eng	Tom still hopes he can win.
eng	Tom told me that he thought Mary wouldn't do that.
eng	When will you do that next?
eng	Tom should've slept longer.
eng	Tom told me that he thought Mary would be worried.
eng	When does the museum close?
eng	Tom should do that with us.
eng	Tom told me that he thought Mary would be jealous.
eng	When do you plan on eating?
eng	Tom should be more patient.
eng	Tom told me that he thought Mary would be furious.
eng	What will you eat tomorrow?
eng	Tom seemed very interested.
eng	Tom told me that he thought Mary would be curious.
eng	What programs do you watch?
eng	Tom seemed unsophisticated.
eng	Tom told me that he thought Mary would be careful.
eng	What else needs to be done?
eng	Tom seemed to know the way.
eng	Tom told me that he thought Mary would be at home.
eng	What did you do after that?
eng	Tom seemed to be very sick.
eng	Tom told me that he thought Mary was undependable.
eng	What did you buy yesterday?
eng	Tom seemed to be very rich.
eng	Tom told me that he thought Mary was disorganized.
eng	What did you buy in Boston?
eng	Tom seemed to be very calm.
eng	Tom told me that he thought Mary was discontented.
eng	We've both never done that.
eng	Tom seemed to be uncertain.
eng	Tom told me that he thought Mary was disappointed.
eng	We're not doing that today.
eng	Tom seemed to be terrified.
eng	Tom told me that he thought Mary was conservative.
eng	We wanted to sing together.
eng	Tom seemed to be skeptical.
eng	Tom told me that he thought Mary was ambidextrous.
eng	We need three more glasses.
eng	Tom seemed to be satisfied.
eng	Tom told Mary he didn't want her to do that again.
eng	We have to travel together.
eng	Tom seemed to be plastered.
eng	Tom thought Mary might want to do that by herself.
eng	We don't often leave early.
eng	Tom seemed to be perplexed.
eng	Tom thought Mary might not be required to do that.
eng	We didn't do that together.
eng	Tom seemed to be organized.
eng	Tom thought Mary might need to do that by herself.
eng	We both did that yesterday.
eng	Tom seemed to be motivated.
eng	Tom thought Mary might have to do that by herself.
eng	We all enjoyed the concert.
eng	Tom seemed to be miserable.
eng	Tom should've asked Mary if she could leave early.
eng	We all did that same thing.
eng	Tom seemed to be irritated.
eng	Tom says Mary doesn't believe John went yesterday.
eng	Watch me do that once more.
eng	Tom seemed to be in charge.
eng	Tom said he'd expected Mary to get home on Monday.
eng	This cloth isn't very good.
eng	Tom seemed to be impressed.
eng	Tom said he wanted to buy one of Mary's paintings.
eng	This can't be used anymore.
eng	Tom seemed to be impatient.
eng	Tom said he thought Mary needed to get more sleep.
eng	This can no longer be used.
eng	Tom seemed to be horrified.
eng	Tom said he doesn't think Mary will do that again.
eng	This book is really useful.
eng	Tom seemed to be flustered.
eng	Tom said he didn't have to stay home to help Mary.
eng	There's only one clean cup.
eng	Tom seemed to be exhausted.
eng	Tom said he didn't have as much free time as Mary.
eng	There isn't much wine left.
eng	Tom seemed to be easygoing.
eng	Tom said he didn't have as many cats as Mary does.
eng	The two of us ate together.
eng	Tom seemed to be disgusted.
eng	Tom said Mary was the only one who didn't do that.
eng	That's not how we did that.
eng	Tom seemed to be desperate.
eng	Tom said Mary didn't want to walk home by herself.
eng	That's a famous restaurant.
eng	Tom seemed to be depressed.
eng	Tom probably shouldn't tell Mary that he did that.
eng	Tell me where you found it.
eng	Tom seemed to be contented.
eng	Tom knew Mary wouldn't be able do that by herself.
eng	Tell me what you want done.
eng	Tom seemed to be confident.
eng	Tom isn't the one who gave me Mary's phone number.
eng	Please turn the radio down.
eng	Tom seemed to be concerned.
eng	Tom doesn't believe Mary can take care of herself.
eng	Please go swimming with me.
eng	Tom seemed to be conceited.
eng	Tom didn't seem to want that as badly as Mary did.
eng	Please don't open the door.
eng	Tom seemed to be competent.
eng	Tom didn't seem to really enjoy talking with Mary.
eng	Our company isn't very big.
eng	Tom seemed to be attentive.
eng	Tom didn't do that the way Mary told him to do it.
eng	One of us ought to do that.
eng	Tom seemed to be all right.
eng	Tom bet me thirty dollars that Mary would be late.
eng	Of course I didn't do that.
eng	Tom seemed reluctant to go.
eng	Tom asked Mary if she wanted him to walk her home.
eng	Let's try to sing together.
eng	Tom seemed like a nice boy.
eng	Tom and Mary travel together as often as they can.
eng	Let's meet at the hospital.
eng	Tom seemed like a good kid.
eng	Tom and Mary need to discuss what they need to do.
eng	Let's go shopping tomorrow.
eng	Tom seemed glad to be home.
eng	Tom advised Mary to stop eating so much junk food.
eng	Let's do that by ourselves.
eng	Tom seemed different today.
eng	Neither Tom nor Mary is likely to want to do that.
eng	Let's do that after school.
eng	Tom seemed as busy as ever.
eng	I tried to convince Tom to go to Boston with Mary.
eng	Let's all do that together.
eng	Tom says that he won't win.
eng	I heard from Tom that Mary does that every Monday.
eng	It's really cold, isn't it?
eng	Tom says that he won't cry.
eng	I haven't seen Tom since he and Mary got divorced.
eng	It's muggy today, isn't it?
eng	Tom says that he can't win.
eng	I don't think Tom wants to go to Boston with Mary.
eng	It smells like it's rotten.
eng	Tom says he can't eat nuts.
eng	I don't think Tom knows why Mary wants to do that.
eng	It should be OK to eat now.
eng	Tom said that he won't win.
eng	I don't think Tom knows why Mary isn't here today.
eng	It looks like you're upset.
eng	Tom said that I should win.
eng	I don't think Tom knows why Mary doesn't eat meat.
eng	It looks like you're tired.
eng	Tom said he's going to win.
eng	I don't think Tom knows where Mary studies French.
eng	It looks like you're tense.
eng	Tom said he's glad you won.
eng	I don't think Tom knows where Mary studied French.
eng	It looks like you're ready.
eng	Tom said he'd probably win.
eng	I don't think Tom knows where Mary parked the car.
eng	It looks like you're drunk.
eng	Tom said he'd go to church.
eng	I don't think Tom knows where Mary graduated from.
eng	It looks like you're bored.
eng	Tom said he wouldn't dance.
eng	I don't think Tom knows where Mary goes to school.
eng	It looks like you're angry.
eng	Tom said he did that wrong.
eng	I don't think Tom knows what Mary wants him to do.
eng	Is that an expensive watch?
eng	Tom regrets leaving Boston.
eng	I don't think Tom knows what Mary is trying to do.
eng	Is it hard to speak French?
eng	Tom painted the wall green.
eng	I don't think Tom knows how much money Mary makes.
eng	Is it all right to eat now?
eng	Tom opened the door for me.
eng	I don't think Tom knows how Mary feels about that.
eng	If you want to go, you may.
eng	Tom needs to eat something.
eng	I don't think Tom knows either Mary or her sister.
eng	I've never been in a canoe.
eng	Tom needed to do that, too.
eng	I don't think Tom has to tell Mary how to do that.
eng	I've found a job in Boston.
eng	Tom must've been horrified.
eng	I don't think Tom has any idea what Mary is doing.
eng	I'm sure you can't do that.
eng	Tom might agree to do that.
eng	I don't think Tom has any idea what Mary has done.
eng	I'm sure somebody will cry.
eng	Tom may not be able to win.
eng	I don't think Tom can do that without Mary's help.
eng	I'm still a French teacher.
eng	Tom may go home by himself.
eng	I didn't think Tom would tell Mary how to do that.
eng	I'm sorry. I can't do that.
eng	Tom looks like he's scared.
eng	I didn't think Tom would show Mary how to do that.
eng	I'm sorry I didn't do that.
eng	Tom looks like he's lonely.
eng	Do you know when Tom and Mary are getting married?
eng	I'm really glad I did that.
eng	Tom looks like he's hungry.
eng	Did you know that Tom and Mary often eat together?
eng	I'm not afraid of your dog.
eng	Tom looks like he's asleep.
eng	Tom would be surprised if he saw Mary doing that.
eng	I'm in no hurry to go home.
eng	Tom looks like he's amused.
eng	Tom wasn't with me at the time Mary was murdered.
eng	I'm hoping to go to Boston.
eng	Tom looks like he's afraid.
eng	Tom wasn't the only one who knew where Mary went.
eng	I'm glad you waited for me.
eng	Tom looked like he was wet.
eng	Tom wasn't the one who showed Mary around Boston.
eng	I'm glad I got there early.
eng	Tom looked like he was sad.
eng	Tom wasn't the one who convinced Mary to do that.
eng	I'll have to do that alone.
eng	Tom looked like he was mad.
eng	Tom wasn't able to understand anything Mary said.
eng	I'll do that if you insist.
eng	Tom looked like he was hot.
eng	Tom was much quicker at doing that than Mary was.
eng	I'll buy you a ticket, too.
eng	Tom knows we can't do that.
eng	Tom tried to help Mary, but she wouldn't let him.
eng	I'll be home all afternoon.
eng	Tom knows that I won't win.
eng	Tom told me that he thought Mary would be scared.
eng	I'd rather not go with you.
eng	Tom knows I didn't do that.
eng	Tom told me that he thought Mary would be absent.
eng	I'd prefer to stay at home.
eng	Tom knew that he could win.
eng	Tom told me that he thought Mary was unimpressed.
eng	I'd never make you do that.
eng	Tom knew he'd have to wait.
eng	Tom told me that he thought Mary was unconvinced.
eng	I'd never done that before.
eng	Tom isn't wrong about that.
eng	Tom told me that he thought Mary was unconscious.
eng	I'd never do that that way.
eng	Tom isn't very influential.
eng	Tom told me that he thought Mary was trustworthy.
eng	I'd never agree to do that.
eng	Tom isn't the only witness.
eng	Tom told me that he thought Mary was sympathetic.
eng	I'd like to try doing that.
eng	Tom isn't tall for his age.
eng	Tom told me that he thought Mary was interesting.
eng	I'd be fired if I did that.
eng	Tom isn't living in Boston.
eng	Tom told me that he thought Mary was intelligent.
eng	I wouldn't let you do that.
eng	Tom isn't eating right now.
eng	Tom told me that he thought Mary was incompetent.
eng	I wouldn't let that happen.
eng	Tom isn't crying right now.
eng	Tom told me that he thought Mary was embarrassed.
eng	I wonder where I should go.
eng	Tom isn't a friend of mine.
eng	Tom told me that he thought Mary was discouraged.
eng	I won't sell my car to you.
eng	Tom is with his girlfriend.
eng	Tom told me that he thought Mary was a good cook.

eng	Tom is wearing a nice suit.
eng	Tom told me he didn't have as much money as Mary.

eng	Tom is wearing a gray suit.
eng	Tom told Mary that she should eat healthier food.
eng	I went to Boston on Monday.
eng	Tom is waiting for a reply.
eng	Tom told Mary that he wouldn't be at her wedding.
eng	I went to Boston last week.
eng	Tom is very claustrophobic.
eng	Tom told Mary she wouldn't be allowed to do that.
eng	I went into the wrong room.
eng	Tom is unwilling to change.
eng	Tom told Mary he hoped he didn't have to do that.
eng	I was in my office all day.
eng	Tom is too busy to eat now.
eng	Tom thought Mary might not need to do that again.
eng	I was brought up in Boston.
eng	Tom is tired of doing that.
eng	Tom thought Mary might not have to do that again.
eng	I was able to buy a ticket.
eng	Tom is the person that won.
eng	Tom thought Mary might not be allowed to do that.
eng	I wanted to stay in Boston.
eng	Tom is taking off his coat.
eng	Tom thought Mary might have to do that on Monday.
eng	I wanted to move to Boston.
eng	Tom is supposed to help me.
eng	Tom seemed to be angry, but not as angry as Mary.
eng	I wanted to live in Boston.
eng	Tom is probably still weak.
eng	Tom said he's sure Mary can take care of herself.
eng	I wanted to buy a notebook.
eng	Tom is probably still lost.
eng	Tom said he wouldn't do that, so I asked Mary to.
eng	I want to do some shopping.
eng	Tom is probably still here.
eng	Tom said he thought Mary needed to do that today.
eng	I want to be ready by 2:30.
eng	Tom is probably still cold.
eng	Tom said he thinks Mary can take care of herself.
eng	I waited for three minutes.
eng	Tom is probably still busy.
eng	Tom said he suspected that Mary wouldn't do that.
eng	I tried to do that quickly.
eng	Tom is probably eating now.
eng	Tom said he knew that Mary wouldn't win the race.
eng	I told you I could do that.
eng	Tom is probably crying now.
eng	Tom said he hopes Mary won't get home by herself.
eng	I thought you spoke French.
eng	Tom is playing with a ball.
eng	Tom said he hopes Mary tries her best to do that.
eng	I thought we could do that.
eng	Tom is now walking the dog.
eng	Tom said Mary almost died on the operating table.
eng	I thought it wouldn't hurt.
eng	Tom is likely to walk here.
eng	Tom probably shouldn't tell Mary why he did that.
eng	I think you're a great guy.
eng	Tom is having a lot of fun.
eng	Tom probably shouldn't tell Mary how he did that.

eng	Tom didn't want any coffee.
eng	I wonder what made Tom think Mary has to do that?
eng	I know where you were born.
eng	Tom didn't study yesterday.
eng	I wonder what made Tom think Mary had to do that?
eng	I know that we can do that.
eng	Tom didn't sound convinced.

eng	Tom couldn't have done that without Mary's help.
eng	Why does it matter to you?
eng	Tom told me he was unhurt.
eng	Tom believes that Mary can take care of herself.
eng	Why does it matter anyhow?
eng	Tom told me he was scared.
eng	Tom asked Mary if she thought she could do that.
eng	Why do I have to eat this?
eng	Tom told me he was lonely.
eng	Tom and Mary plan on getting married in October.
eng	Why aren't you eating now?

eng	Tom and Mary never should've done that together.
eng	Who told you that I snore?

eng	Tom and Mary have always been very good friends.
eng	Who do you think did that?
eng	Tom told me he understood.
eng	Tom and Mary could've gotten home by themselves.

eng	I wonder what made Tom think Mary won't do that?
eng	What's your doctor's name?
eng	Tom told me he had a cold.
eng	I wonder how Tom knew Mary was going to be here.

eng	What does that sound like?
eng	Tom told me he enjoyed it.
eng	I think Tom shouldn't tell Mary how he did that.

eng	Tom seemed to be thrilled.
eng	Both Tom and Mary didn't go to school yesterday.
eng	We could do that together.
eng	Tom seemed to be stressed.
eng	Was Tom the one who showed Mary how to do that?
eng	We can definitely do that.
eng	Tom seemed to be stranded.
eng	Tom wouldn't do that, so I asked Mary to do it.

eng	If you want to come, come.
eng	Tom promised not to laugh.
eng	Tom isn't the only boy invited to Mary's party.

eng	I'm starting to get tired.
eng	Tom opened the jar for me.
eng	Tom isn't sure Mary knew she needed to do that.
eng	I'm not scared to do that.
eng	Tom needs to do that, too.
eng	Tom is waiting for Mary outside the restaurant.
eng	I'm not in Boston anymore.
eng	Tom must've been thrilled.
eng	Tom is very sure Mary can take care of herself.
eng	I'm married to a Canadian.
eng	Tom must've been offended.
eng	Tom is the one who gave me Mary's phone number.
eng	I'm looking for my ticket.
eng	Tom might not wait for us.
eng	Tom has already told Mary not to do that again.
eng	I'm in Boston on business.
eng	Tom might not leave today.
eng	Tom forgot to tell Mary what needed to be done.
eng	I'm headed back to Boston.

eng	Tom and Mary are always traveling together.
eng	I got arrested in Boston.
eng	Tom wasn't my assistant.
eng	I wonder if Tom will take Mary to the prom.
eng	I gave each boy an apple.
eng	Tom wasn't making sense.
eng	I wonder if Tom is still smarter than Mary.
eng	I drove my car to Boston.
eng	Tom wasn't in our group.
eng	I think Tom went to Mary's house yesterday.
eng	I don't want to kiss you.
eng	Tom wasn't here tonight.
eng	I think Tom shouldn't tell Mary to do that.
eng	I don't think it matters.
eng	Tom wasn't good-looking.
eng	I think Tom forgot to tell Mary what to do.
eng	I don't laugh very often.
eng	Tom wasn't good at math.
eng	I knew Tom wouldn't let Mary go home early.

eng	Tom wasn't at all upset.
eng	I don't think Tom knows what Mary has done.
eng	I can't wait to meet you.
eng	Tom wasn't always wrong.
eng	I don't think Tom knows that Mary is upset.
eng	I can't possibly do that.
eng	Tom wasn't always right.
eng	I don't think Tom knows that Mary did that.
eng	I can't lie to you again.

eng	Don't we have to do that?
eng	Tom was writing a novel.
eng	Tom was surprised when he saw Mary crying.
eng	Does this door open, too?

eng	Tom must've thought Mary wouldn't do that.
eng	Which book did you read?
eng	Tom thinks you can swim.
eng	Tom isn't worried that Mary won't do that.
eng	Where's your dictionary?
eng	Tom thinks he could win.
eng	Tom isn't the one who helped Mary do that.
eng	Where do they sell that?
eng	Tom still might not win.
eng	Tom isn't able to get Mary to do anything.
eng	Where did you go skiing?
eng	Tom should sing with us.
eng	Tom is the one who wanted Mary to do that.
eng	When do you plan to eat?
eng	Tom seemed to be unsure.
eng	Tom is sure Mary can take care of herself.
eng	What sort of book is it?
eng	Tom seemed to be unhurt.
eng	Tom is supposed to go to Boston with Mary.
eng	What kind of book is it?
eng	Tom seemed to be uneasy.
eng	Tom didn't seem to be as busy as Mary was.
eng	What else did you write?
eng	Tom seemed to be stupid.
eng	Tom didn't do that and Mary didn't either.
eng	What does that refer to?
eng	Tom seemed to be stoned.
eng	Tom convinced Mary to loan him some money.
eng	What does that all mean?
eng	Tom seemed to be sleepy.
eng	Tom convinced Mary to lend him some money.
eng	What did that look like?
eng	Tom seemed to be shaken.
eng	Tom asked Mary to wait until he got there.
eng	We've got to go do that.
eng	Tom seemed to be scared.
eng	Tom and Mary used to be very good friends.
eng	We'll do that ourselves.
eng	Tom seemed to be normal.
eng	Tom and Mary have never done that with me.
eng	We'd better leave early.
eng	Tom seemed to be lonely.
eng	Tom and Mary have decided to eat together.
eng	We should sing together.
eng	Tom seemed to be honest.
eng	Tom and Mary didn't go to school together.
eng	We didn't sing together.
eng	Tom seemed to be guilty.
eng	Tom and Mary are going to travel together.
eng	Today is cold, isn't it?
eng	Tom seemed to be groggy.
eng	Tom and Mary are finally going to do that.
eng	This restaurant is good.
eng	Tom seemed to be clever.
eng	Tom and Mary are doing that by themselves.
eng	This one is even better.
eng	Tom seemed to be bright.
eng	Tom accused Mary of stealing his computer.
eng	This is how you do that.
eng	Tom seemed to be biased.
eng	Neither Tom nor Mary want to go to Boston.
eng	This is a chrysanthemum.
eng	Tom seemed to be asleep.
eng	Neither Tom nor Mary is likely to do that.
eng	This gravy is too salty.
eng	Tom seemed to be amused.
eng	Neither Tom nor Mary covered their mouths.
eng	This chair is well made.
eng	Tom seemed really happy.
eng	Maybe Tom told Mary she shouldn't do that.
eng	This building is a bank.
eng	Tom seemed pretty happy.
eng	Maybe Tom told Mary she needed to do that.
eng	The noise kept me awake.
eng	Tom seemed happy enough.
eng	It was Tom who warned Mary not to do that.
eng	The children kept quiet.
eng	Tom seemed disorganized.
eng	I wonder why Tom didn't do that with Mary.
eng	That's not a dictionary.
eng	Tom seemed discontented.
eng	I knew Tom would tell Mary how to do that.
eng	That isn't yours, is it?
eng	Tom seemed apprehensive.
eng	I knew Tom would show Mary how to do that.
eng	That hat doesn't fit me.
eng	Tom seemed almost happy.
eng	I heard from Tom that Mary didn't do that.
eng	Tell me what to do next.
eng	Tom says that he'll win.
eng	I don't think Tom knows why Mary did that.
eng	Should we do that again?
eng	Tom says he should wait.
eng	I don't think Tom knows where Mary is now.
eng	Should I really do that?
eng	Tom says he never cried.
eng	I don't think Tom knows what Mary will do.
eng	Please walk more slowly.
eng	Tom says I need to wait.

eng	Tom wouldn't do that, so I asked Mary to.
eng	Please mail this letter.
eng	Tom said I ought to win.
eng	Tom won't likely run into Mary in Boston.
eng	Please lend me your pen.
eng	Tom said I had to leave.
eng	Tom wasn't worried Mary wouldn't do that.
eng	Please give these to me.
eng	Tom really wants to win.
eng	Tom wasn't the only one who trusted Mary.
eng	Please give me one, too.

eng	Tom wasn't the one who died. It was Mary.
eng	Please do that together.
eng	Tom promised he'll wait.
eng	Tom wasn't surprised that Mary showed up.
eng	Please clean this place.
eng	Tom probably didn't win.
eng	Tom told me that he thought Mary was shy.
eng	Not many people do that.
eng	Tom probably didn't cry.
eng	Tom told me that he thought Mary was sad.
eng	Nobody wants to do that.
eng	Tom never cries anymore.
eng	Tom told me that he thought Mary was mad.
eng	May I do that right now?
eng	Tom must've been hungry.
eng	Tom told me that he thought Mary was hot.
eng	May I borrow this chair?
eng	Tom must've been asleep.

eng	Let's not eat right now.
eng	Tom might've left early.
eng	Tom told Mary she didn't need to do that.
eng	Let's do that right now.
eng	Tom may not be sleeping.
eng	Tom told Mary he wasn't going to do that.
eng	Let's all sing together.
eng	Tom looks like he's sad.
eng	Tom thinks Mary can take care of herself.
eng	Let me read you a story.
eng	Tom looks like he's mad.
eng	Tom seemed to know all about Mary's past.
eng	It's too hot to eat now.
eng	Tom looks like he's hot.
eng	Tom seemed reluctant to do that for Mary.
eng	It'll soon be Christmas.
eng	Tom looks healthy to me.
eng	Tom said he'd assumed Mary would do that.
eng	It wasn't hot yesterday.
eng	Tom knows why you cried.
eng	Tom said he knew why Mary didn't do that.
eng	It looks like you're OK.

eng	Tom said he hoped that Mary wouldn't cry.
eng	Is it OK not to do that?
eng	Tom isn't wearing jeans.
eng	Tom said Mary hardly ever smiles anymore.
eng	I've overstayed my visa.

eng	With a cracking of whips and a creaking of wheels the great waggons got into motion and soon the whole caravan was winding along once more.
rus	Эта история напомнила мне об одном старом друге.
eng	His iron constitution enabled him to work morning and evening at improving and tilling his lands.
eng	His farm and all that belonged to him prospered exceedingly.
eng	As year succeeded to year she grew taller and stronger, her cheek more ruddy and her step more elastic.
eng	Many a wayfarer upon the high road which ran by Ferrier's farm felt long-forgotten thoughts revive in their minds as they watched her lithe, girlish figure tripping through the wheat-fields, or met her mounted upon her father's mustang, and managing it with all the ease and grace of a true child of the West.
eng	Down the dusty high roads defiled long streams of heavily-laden mules, all heading to the west, for the gold fever had broken out in California.
eng	She had a commission from her father in the city, and was dashing in as she had done many a time before, with all the fearlessness of youth, thinking only of her task and how it was to be performed.
eng	She had reached the outskirts of the city when she found the road blocked by a great drove of cattle, driven by a half-dozen wild-looking herdsmen from the plains.
eng	"Good-bye," he answered, raising his broad sombrero, and bending over her little hand.
rus	Ты говоришь по-литовски?
eng	Young Jefferson Hope rode on with his companions, gloomy and taciturn.
eng	The sight of the fair young girl, as frank and wholesome as the Sierra breezes, had stirred his volcanic, untamed heart to its very depths.
rus	У нас с тобой разные вкусы.
eng	The love which had sprung up in his heart was not the sudden, changeable fancy of a boy, but rather the wild, fierce passion of a man of strong will and imperious temper.
eng	He had been accustomed to succeed in all that he undertook.
eng	He had been a pioneer in California, and could narrate many a strange tale of fortunes made and fortunes lost in those wild, halcyon days.
eng	He had been a scout too, and a trapper, a silver explorer, and a ranchman.
eng	He soon became a favourite with the old farmer, who spoke eloquently of his virtues. On such occasions, Lucy was silent, but her blushing cheek and her bright, happy eyes showed only too clearly that her young heart was no longer her own.
eng	One summer evening he came galloping down the road and pulled up at the gate. She was at the doorway, and came down to meet him.
eng	He threw the bridle over the fence and strode up the pathway.
eng	"I am off, Lucy," he said, taking her two hands in his, and gazing tenderly down into her face; "I won't ask you to come with me now, but will you be ready to come when I am here again?" "And when will that be?" she asked, blushing and laughing.
eng	There's no one who can stand between us.
eng	"And how about father?" she asked.
eng	The longer I stay, the harder it will be to go.
eng	He tore himself from her as he spoke, and, flinging himself upon his horse, galloped furiously away, never even looking round, as though afraid that his resolution might fail him if he took one glance at what he was leaving.
eng	She stood at the gate, gazing after him until he vanished from her sight. Then she walked back into the house the happiest girl in all Utah.
eng	Oh, father, father, what shall we do?
eng	She could not help observing that he paid unusual care to the fastening of the doors that night, and that he carefully cleaned and loaded the rusty old shotgun which hung upon the wall of his bedroom.
eng	As he approached his farm, he was surprised to see a horse hitched to each of the posts of the gate.
por	Eu posso ganhar.
por	Tom fuma.
por	Eu desprezo o Tom.
eng	Still more surprised was he on entering to find two young men in possession of his sitting-room. One, with a long pale face, was leaning back in the rocking-chair, with his feet cocked up upon the stove. The other, a bull-necked youth with coarse, bloated features, was standing in front of the window with his hands in his pockets whistling a popular hymn.
por	Tom o comeu.
eng	"There are two ways out of the room," cried Ferrier; "there is the door, and there is the window. Which do you care to use?"
por	Eu odiava o Tom.
por	Tom pode ganhar.
por	Tom deixa Mary ganhar.
rus	Проблемы Тома на этом не кончились.
eng	He concealed his fears from his daughter, however, and affected to make light of the whole matter, though she, with the keen eye of love, saw plainly that he was ill at ease.
eng	Outside all was calm and quiet.
eng	The stars were twinkling brightly overhead.
eng	It's Lucy that brings me here, and before harm comes on her I guess there will be one less o' the Hope family in Utah.
eng	I have a mule and two horses waiting in the Eagle Ravine.
eng	"How much money have you?" "Two thousand dollars in gold, and five in notes."
eng	The greeting between the lovers was warm, but brief, for minutes were precious, and there was much to be done.
eng	"We must make our start at once," said Jefferson Hope, speaking in a low but resolute voice.
eng	Are you taking the piss?
eng	The front and back entrances are watched, but with caution we may get away through the side window and across the fields.
eng	Once on the road we are only two miles from the Ravine where the horses are waiting.
eng	By daybreak we should be halfway through the mountains.
eng	Ferrier carried the bag of gold and notes, Jefferson Hope had the scanty provisions and water, while Lucy had a small bundle containing a few of her more valued possessions.
eng	Opening the window very slowly and carefully, they waited until a dark cloud had somewhat obscured the night, and then one by one passed through into the little garden.
eng	With bated breath and crouching figures they stumbled across the garden, and gained the shelter of the hedge, which they skirted until they came to the gap which opened into the cornfield.
eng	They had just reached this point when the young man seized his two companions and dragged them down into the shadow, where they lay silent and trembling.
rus	Тома ведь там не было?
eng	His prairie training had given Jefferson Hope the ears of a lynx.
rus	Том вдруг расхохотался.
eng	Two dark, jagged peaks loomed above them through the darkness.
eng	On a rock which overlooked the track, showing out dark and plain against the sky, there stood a solitary sentinel.
rus	Не думаю, что мы ещё увидимся.
eng	When morning broke, a scene of marvellous though savage beauty lay before them.
eng	In every direction the great snow-capped peaks hemmed them in, peeping over each other's shoulders to the far horizon. So steep were the rocky banks on either side of them that the larch and the pine seemed to be suspended over their heads, and to need only a gust of wind to come hurtling down upon them.
eng	As they passed, a great rock came thundering down with a hoarse rattle which woke the echoes in the silent gorges, and startled the weary horses into a gallop.
eng	As the sun rose slowly above the eastern horizon, the caps of the great mountains lit up one after the other, like lamps at a festival, until they were all ruddy and glowing.
eng	The magnificent spectacle cheered the hearts of the three fugitives and gave them fresh energy.
rus	У меня тогда не было работы.
rus	Я тогда был без работы.
eng	At a wild torrent which swept out of a ravine they called a halt and watered their horses, while they partook of a hasty breakfast.
rus	Тому не с кем было обсудить свои проблемы.
eng	Do I have to do everything myself?
eng	He saw the old man and the young girl crouching over the blazing fire.
rus	Том понятия не имел, что Мэри хочет это сделать.
eng	From the marks upon the bark of the trees, and other indications, he judged that there were numerous bears in the vicinity.
eng	On the edge of a jutting pinnacle, three or four hundred feet above him, there stood a creature somewhat resembling a sheep in appearance, but armed with a pair of gigantic horns.
rus	Я почти никогда не выхожу после наступления темноты.
rus	Том понятия не имел, что Мэри его так ненавидит.
eng	Weighed down with his burden, and weary from his exertions, he stumbled along, keeping up his heart by the reflection that every step brought him nearer to Lucy.
rus	Том понятия не имел, что Мэри так сильно его ненавидит.
eng	It was only too clear that some sudden and terrible disaster had occurred during his absence.
rus	Том добрался до дома как раз перед тем, как начался дождь.
eng	Go fetch some water from the well.
rus	Пациент умер от рака лёгких.
eng	For some months Jefferson Hope lingered among the mountains, leading a strange, wild life, and nursing in his heart the fierce desire for vengeance which possessed him.
eng	Tales were told in the city of the weird figure which was seen prowling about the suburbs, and which haunted the lonely mountain gorges.
rus	Ты сегодня уезжаешь?
eng	When he reached St. Petersburg, they had departed for Paris; and when he followed them there, he learned that they had just set off for Copenhagen.
eng	"I guess you're going to take me to the police-station," he remarked to Sherlock Holmes.

rus	Тебе этого хватит?
rus	Вам этого хватит?

rus	Разве вам этого недостаточно?

eng	I must warn you that your words will be taken down, and may be used against you.
rus	Вам этого не хватит?
eng	"I confess," said I, "that I do not quite follow you." "I hardly expected that you would."
eng	Most people, if you describe a train of events to them, will tell you what the result would be. They can put those events together in their minds, and argue from them that something will come to pass. There are few people, however, who, if you told them a result, would be able to evolve from their own inner consciousness what the steps were which led up to that result. This power is what I mean when I talk of reasoning backwards, or analytically.
eng	There is no branch of detective science which is so important and so much neglected as the art of tracing footsteps.
eng	Can't you even do that right?
eng	Tom walked slowly down the garden path.
eng	Robbery had not been the object of the murder, for nothing was taken. Was it politics, then, or was it a woman? That was the question which confronted me.
eng	Tom gave flowers to Mary.
eng	Supposing one man wished to dog another through London, what better means could he adopt than to turn cabdriver?
eng	With his long, white, nervous fingers he adjusted the delicate needle and rolled back his left shirtcuff.

eng	Understood in its totality, the spectacle is both the result and the goal of the dominant mode of production. It is not a mere decoration added to the real world. It is the very heart of this real society's unreality. In all of its particular manifestations — news, propaganda, advertising, entertainment — the spectacle represents the dominant model of life. It is the omnipresent affirmation of the choices that have already been made in the sphere of production and in the consumption implied by that production. In both form and content the spectacle serves as a total justification of the conditions and goals of the existing system. The spectacle also represents the constant presence of this justification since it monopolizes the majority of the time spent outside the production process.
fra	Le spectacle, compris dans sa totalité, est à la fois le résultat et le projet du mode de production existant. Il n'est pas un supplément au monde réel, sa décoration surajoutée. Il est le cœur de l'irréalisme de la société réelle. Sous toutes ses formes particulières, information ou propagande, publicité ou consommation directe de divertissements, le spectacle constitue le modèle présent de la vie socialement dominante. Il est l'affirmation omniprésente du choix déjà fait dans la production, et sa consommation corollaire. Forme et contenu du spectacle sont identiquement la justification totale des conditions et des fins du système existant. Le spectacle est aussi la présence permanente de cette justification, en tant qu'occupation de la part principale du temps vécu hors de la production moderne.
epo	La spektaklo, komprenita kiel tuto, estas samtempe la rezulto kaj la projekto de la nuna produktada reĝimo. Ĝi ne estas nura aldono al la reala mondo, ĝia surmetita ornamento. Ĝi estas la koro de la nerealeco de la reala socio. En ĉiuj ĝiaj specialaj formoj, informo aŭ propagando, reklamado aŭ rekta konsumado de amuzaĵoj, la spektaklo konsistigas la socie regantan modelon de la hodiaŭa vivo. Ĝi estas la ĉieesta jesado al la elektoj jam faritaj en la sfero de produktado kaj ĝia korolario, konsumado. La formo kaj enhavo de la spektaklo estas idente la tuta pravigo de la kondiĉoj kaj la celoj de la ekzistanta sistemo. La spektaklo estas ankaŭ la permanenta ĉeesto de tiu pravigo tial, ke ĝi okupas la ĉefan parton de la tempo pasigata ekster la moderna produktado.

deu	Die Tragik des modernen Menschen ist nicht, dass er immer weniger über den Sinn des eigenen Lebens weiß, sondern dass ihn das immer weniger stört.
epo	La tragedio de moderna homo ne estas, ke li estas ĉiam malpli konscia pri la senco de sia propra vivo, sed ke ĝi estas al li ĉiam malpli ĝenanta.
deu	Mitnichten ist der Baum zuerst Same, dann Spross, dann biegsamer Stamm, dann dürres Holz. Man darf ihn nicht zerlegen, wenn man ihn kennenlernen will. Der Baum ist jene Macht, die sich langsam mit dem Himmel vermählt.
deu	Der Geist einer Sprache offenbart sich am deutlichsten in ihren unübersetzbaren Worten.
epo	Ne nur estas la arbo unue semo, tiam ŝoso, tiam fleksebla trunko, tiam seka ligno. Vi ne povas malmunti ĝin, se oni volas konatiĝi lin. La arbo estas tiu potenco, kiu malrapide kunigas la ĉielon.
deu	Gedanken gleichen einem Zug. Kaum eingestiegen trägt er dich davon, oft ohne zu wissen, wo der Ausstieg ist oder wo die Reise hinführt. Die wahre Natur seiner Gedanken zu erkennen, bedeutet aussteigen zu können – zu jeder Zeit.
epo	Pensoj similas trajnon. Tuj kiam vi eniris, ĝi forportos vin, ofte sen scii, kie estas la eliro aŭ kie la vojaĝo finiĝos. Rekompreni la veran naturon de viaj pensoj, signifas povi eliri – en ajna momento.
deu	Frieden für die Menschheit können wir nur erreichen, wenn wir damit beginnen, den Frieden in uns selbst zu realisieren.
epo	Pacon por la homaro ni nur povas atingi, kiam ni komencas realigi pacon en ni mem.
deu	Vergangenheit und Zukunft sind von der Liebe selbst. Erwartungen und Erinnerungen werden ihr nicht gerecht. Liebe, die eine Ursache hat, wird immer auch ein Ende finden.
epo	La estinteco kaj la estonteco estas de la amo mem. Atendoj kaj memoroj ne faras justecon al ĝi. Amo, kiu havas kaŭzon, ĉiam trovos finon.
deu	Addiert man zu der Zeit, die manche täglich mit Planen, Warten und Vorsorgen verbringen, noch die des Erinnerns und Nachgrübelns hinzu, dann errät man leicht, warum ihnen keine Zeit zum Leben selbst mehr bleibt.
epo	Adicias oni al tiu tempo, kiun kelkaj ĉiutage planas, atendas kaj antaŭzorgas kaj aldoniĝas la memoron kaj pripenson, tiam oni facile divenas, kial al ili ne restas tempo por la vivo mem.
